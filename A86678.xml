            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I behold the prodigious prepoſture and confuſion which reigneth in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions (where ſervants ride on horſe-back, and Princes walk on foot; where ſubjects are clavered up into the Kings Throne, and the King debaſed below the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a free-born ſubject) me thinks the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God (whoſe caſtigations of his children are his ordinary Heraulds to proclaime his Commands of Reformation) doth by theſe ſacrilegious uſurpations upon your Majeſtyes Sacred Prerogatives, (which have produced theſe National calamities wherein your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is the principal ſufferer) Intimate a National guilt of the like uſurpation upon the more Sacred Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of God (wherein your Majeſty, to whom God hath delegated the Supream Authority, hath been (in a Legal conſtruction) the principal actor) and that God hath permitted your Majeſtyes ſubjects to poſſeſſe themſelves of your Throne, and act as Kings in thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb facs="tcp:114572:3"/>
no King did ever by any Commiſſion Authorize a ſubject, becauſe Your Majeſty hath formerly poſſeſſed your ſelf of Gods Throne, and acted as a God in thoſe things, whereunto God did never by any Commiſſion Authorize a King. Pardon (I beſeech Your Majeſty) my audacious and rude expreſſions (extorted from my pen by the Nature of the matter charging the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Your moſt Sacred Majeſty of a Crime, whereof, I dare be depoſed Your Majeſty was never any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious. For the moſt Sacrilegious Champions of theſe times, have experimented Your conſcientious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be ſo compleatly poſtur'd in the Militia of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Religion, that neither their fierceſt aſſaults, nor ſubtilleſt temptations could ever make them acceſſory to the leaſt thought of alienating thoſe things, which Your Majeſty did believe to be made Sacred only by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary dedication of men: which is an obvious and evident Demonſtration to the world, how horrid and abominable the very thought of a Sacrilegious Intruſion would be to Your Majeſty, (if rightly underſtood) upon thoſe Divine prerogatives which were made Sacred by Gods own inſtitution, from the foundation of the world. And that therefore Your Majeſtyes Aberrations in this kind, have been Circumſtantiated with no leſſe innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſoul, no leſſe zeal to the glory of God, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Church, and the Spiritual welfare of his and Your people, then the Reſolutions of <hi>David</hi> were for building the Temple, or of <hi>Uzzah</hi> for ſaving the Ark of God. So that I cannot but expect theſe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected expreſſions to breed an amazement in Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; for prevention whereof, I ſhal in plain termes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what I underſtand this Sacriledge to be: And that is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114572:3"/>
               <hi>All uſurpation of Power over conſcience in the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lawes and Statutes for the Regulation thereof in matters which are not of Political cogniſance; And under the ſanction of Perſonal or Pecuniary mulcts to enjoyn a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal conformity in confeſſion of Evangelical and Chriſtian Faith, and in Evangelical and Chriſtian forms of worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which were neither <hi>dutyes,</hi> nor indeed <hi>things in rerum Natura,</hi> when Politique Government did firſt receive it's Inſtitution from God; and therefore cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly of Politique cognizance, nor any fundamentall or Eſſential part of the object of Politique Government; as the tenth Chapter of the ſecond Book doth more clearly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The deſign of which Chapter (being the due limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Kings Power <hi>in ordine ad extra Regalia &amp; Metapolitica;)</hi> And of the ſubſequent Chapter (being the due extenſion of the ſubjects obedience <hi>in ordine ad Regalia &amp; Politica</hi>) were the principal Inducements that gave life unto this preſent diſcourſe, and is indeed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice whereunto I do acknowledge my ſelf able to bring more zeal and good affection then any other abilities: yet I could not chuſe but (like <hi>Balaams Aſſe</hi>) Imploy the utmoſt of my pore endeavours to ſecure both my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and his ſubjects from the fierce wrath of that angry <hi>Angel,</hi> which me thought I ſaw ſtanding in the way with a drawne ſword in his hand, ready to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for both their ſacrilegious exorbitances: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolved rather to hazard the cruſhing of my Maſters foot againſt the wall of worldly reputation by an humble and dutiful repreſentation of his errour (which I knew to be committed in the Innocency of his ſoul) then by an undutiful ſilence or palliation thereof, to
<pb facs="tcp:114572:4"/>
prompt or permit him <hi>(quantum in me)</hi> to gallop on into miſchiefes (in my apprehenſion) deſtructive both to his temporal and Spiritual welfare.</p>
            <p>Sr, God is my record, I do not plead this exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſcience from the Iuriſdiction of Regal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for mine own ſake; out of any deſigne that I have thereout to ſuck the leaſt advantage unto my ſelf, either by gaining a toleration to profeſſe or act contrary to any Law, Statute, or Eccleſiaſtical Canon; enjoyning a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in theſe Evangelical duties.

and themſelves (in danger to be precipitated (like that ambitious Aſpirer) into a ſea of perdition and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.)</p>
            <p>For (Notwithſtading I do profeſſe the concurrence of my own judgement with theirs (concerning the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Religion of the deſires of ſuch, who out of an innocent zeal do ſeek the liberty of Conſcience in the exerciſe of thoſe dutyes which are not directly and <hi>perſe</hi> of Politicall cognizance; That ſo (after <hi>Pauls</hi> example, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.) <hi>they may preſerve their Conſciences void of offence towards God, though the way and forme whereby they worſhip that God, may be cenſured for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;</hi> (and that happily alſo, not unjuſtly) in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other men <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet) I hope both my precedent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes and my pen at preſent, will ſufficiently atteſt my deteſtation of their Illegall and Impious practiſes, to compaſſe theſe Legal, honeſt, &amp; warrantable deſires; and thereby Vindicate the innocency of my thoughts from all ſuch unworthy Sycophancy and Temporizement.

            <p>So that my onely deſigne in arguing for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of Conſcience above all Regal Power and Authority in order to theſe Evangelicall and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dutyes, was the diſcharge of mine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in my laſt (as I then ſuppoſed) office of duty and ſervice to Your Majeſty and my fellow ſubjects, by an humble repreſentation of the dangerous (though

I wel hope, Innocent) Aberrations of both; For in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſpringing from a cauſe of that nature; <hi>tam ultimus quam primus ad ſanitatem gradus eſt noviſſe morbum.</hi> And therefore my purpoſe was (out of a ſenſe of my duty towards Your Majeſty and my countrey, who have ſo juſt a Title to any ſervice of mine, which may be any way conducent to Your happineſſe and welfare) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath (as a Legacy) unto each of You, a Soveraign <hi>Recipe,</hi> proper for the cure of each of Your preſent diſtempers.

            <p>And this indeed was the very ſcope and deſigne of the whole Treatiſe, which though it be <hi>ultimum execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> and obtained the laſt place in my Book (the common fate of all ends) yet was <hi>Primum Intentione,</hi> and had the firſt place in my thoughts; So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſpoken in the former book of this Treatiſe (concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Natural Government and the ſeverall ſpecies thereof) or in the latter book
<pb facs="tcp:114572:5"/>
(concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchie</hi> (the onely Legitimate and Natural ſpece of Politique Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) and the ſeveral acceptions thereof) was but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for an Introduction to facilitate the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe precautionary Muniments againſt theſe two ſacrilegious Intruſions, which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the four laſt Chapters of the ſecond book, treating of <hi>Monarchie</hi> in its laſt and Theologicall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>I hope my diſcourſe will not be offenſive to Your Majeſtyes great Councell of State, or the learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of either Tribe, becauſe it endeavoureth to make Divinity ſpeak the Prerogative of the King, and liberty of the ſubject. For though ſome <hi>Ignaros</hi> pretend theſe things to be the peculiar buſineſſe of Statſts &amp; Innes of courtmen, &amp; not of ſchollers &amp; churchmen: yet the more learned ſort are not Ignorant, that all municipal Lawes are or ought to be grounded upon the Externall part of the Morall Law (which is the direct &amp; proper object of Politique Government, and which is the juſt bounds and limits of all humane Power and Authority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſtical or civil;) And therefore will not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the pen of a Divine treating of <hi>Monarchical</hi> duties, to rove <hi>Extra crepidam.</hi> For there is no caſe in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Common Law which is not reducible unto ſome precept of the Morall Law, and therefore muſt needs be capable of a Theological, as well as of a Political cognizance; and to be made a caſe of Conſcience, as well as a Caſe in Law. <hi>At officiis quis Idoneus iſtis?</hi> It is onely the narrowneſſe of our ſufficiency, and not of our profeſſion, which ſecludes the Intereſt of Divines from any humane concernments, whether of Religion or juſtice. I confeſſe the Externall ſanction (which is
<pb facs="tcp:114572:6"/>
the coercive part of a Law or Statute) to be peculiar unto their Politicall cognizance. But the fundamental and directive part of that Law or Statute is no leſſe of our Theologicall cognizance then of their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>
            <p>For it is manifeſt by Chronologie of Scripture that there was a King and a Prieſt, (the one to Rule, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to direct;) many hundreds of years before there was a Lawyer in the world, and that both the Regall &amp; Sacerdotal office and dignity were conjoyned in one perſon, viz: <hi>MelchiZedeck,</hi> who was of greater Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, then <hi>Noah's</hi> flood; after whoſe death (within leſſe then one hundred yeares) this Legiſlative honour (I do not mean that which relates to Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and is peculiar unto Kings: But that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to advice and Councell, and is an honour whereof ſubjects are capable) is by <hi>Jacobs</hi> propheſie entayled upon the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> (as well as the Sacerdotall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) <hi>untill Shiloh come.</hi> And therefore I hope they have no cauſe to be angry that I plead this near affinity of their profeſſion with Theologie. And ſurely if thoſe ſmatterers in State-Policy (whoſe Ignorance makes them apt to carp) were as much maſters in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their own Art, as <hi>Bodin, Berclay,</hi> and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lawyers have been who have writ of this ſubject, they would acknowledge Divinity (and more peculiarly the Holy Scriptures themſelves) to afford a more exact and compleat model of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> and more perfect Rules of Government and obedience, then can be cul'd out of the writings either of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Livie, Tacitus, Bracton, Moor, Smith,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grecian, Romane, or Engliſh Polititian; who by act or ſtory have been moſt renowned in this way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114572:6"/>To exhibit a glimps of which truth, I have purpoſely endeavoured to confine my pen within that Sacred Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umferancce (in a manner) through my whole diſcourſe of <hi>Monarchie:</hi> The defects whereof do not proceed from any barrenneſſe or unaptneſſe in the ſoyl, to bear a crop of this kind of grain, anſwerable to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt Criticall Statiſt, but meerly from the inſufficiencies of the Husbandman, whoſe Indexterity hath reaped this ſorrie Crop, out of that fruitfull and Luxuriant ſoyl.</p>
            <p>And to the intent Your Majeſty may take a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall ſurvey of the whole Treatiſe; I have thereunto prefixed a briefe Analyſis, repreſenting both the ſumme and Method of the ſame, purpoſely thereby to direct Your Princely eye unto that part which Your Majeſty ſhall judge worthy Your peruſal, though indeed the part, which above others I deſigned for that honour, was the tenth Chapter of the ſecond book; in the penning whereof, I had a more particular eye upon Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyes Immediate ſervice, then in any other: Becauſe I conceived the ſubject thereof (being the due limitation of Regal Power <hi>in ordine ad extra regalia</hi>) to be of the moſt Immediate concernment to Your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And thereupon alſo preſumed that it would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Your Majeſty, although it was ſerved up from the hands of an unskilful Cook, no way gifted for ſeaſoning a diſcourſe to reliſh a Palate, ſo exquiſitely judicious as I know Your Majeſties to be. Onely my former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Your Majeſties gracious indulgence (in vouchſafing me the honour to taſt of ſuch homely fare as my rude pen and fancy (which Nature did never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate for courtly flouriſhes of wit or eloquence, the proper food for Princely eyes) have made an Extemporary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb facs="tcp:114572:7"/>
of) hath grounded a confidence in me to preſent unto Your Majeſty this unpoliſh'd publication of mine own judgment, in a buſines ſo far tranſcending my mean abilities, that I prognoſticate a neceſſity of my betraying much weakneſſe &amp; inſufficiency therein; which I reſolve rather to expoſe to the worlds cenſure, then to betray the leaſt want of duty or affection to the ſervice of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who hath honoured me with ſo high a truſt as ſometimes Your Majeſty was pleaſed to repoſe in me: whereof (I conceive) I could not ſhew my ſelfe any way more unworthy, then by my ſilence in a buſineſſe (ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my apprehenſion) of ſo great importance to Your Majeſties preſent and future happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore to inſinuate the promptitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of my ſoul, to make true payment unto Your Majeſty of my due debt of duty and ſervice, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportion of ten thouſand Talents (though the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of my abilities did never <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liZe</hi>) account to one hundred pence) I have compiled this trifling Treatiſe, for the Patrocination whereof I have preſumed to make my addreſſes to Your moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty. For though I know nothing wherefore it ſhould find acceptance or entertainment in the world either for its own ſake, or its Fathers; yet I doubt not but the Relation of ſo Illuſtrious and eminent a God-Father may put an eſtimate upon it in thoſe eyes, from which it could never otherwiſe expect an auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious glance.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould adde the irkſomneſſe of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent prolixity unto my other innumerous exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances; I will conclude theſe Dedicatory addreſſes with that ſhort Petition which Your Majeſtyes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Indulgence hath taught me to ask, viz:

               <hi>Jus or Right</hi> is that which is conformable unto and warrantable by ſome Law.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Natura Naturata Angelica,</hi> whoſe being is purely ſpirituall and celeſtiall, and the perfections and excellencies proper unto Angels in that being, are likewiſe ſpirituall and celeſtiall; And therefore the underſtandings and wils of Angels doe reach unto Celeſtiall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters, viz. Thoſe high and tranſcendent excellencies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God and Celeſtiall joyes, the tranſcendant love and praiſes of God, and other Celeſtiall bleſſings and duties: whereof no other creature is capable in that nature and meaſure as Angels are; although even Angels themſelves are not capable of theſe things in their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Infinite capacity as they are in God, the <hi>Natura Naturante,</hi> but onely in ſuch a finite proportion of perfection and excellencie as is ſuitable to their created and finite (yet moſt excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious)
<pb facs="tcp:114572:13"/>
nature. But yet the underſtandings and wils of Angels are not ſo preciſely limited to theſe Celeſtiall and ſpirituall matters (which is their proper object) but that they participate alſo of whatſoever either Intellectuall or Naturall Agents are capable, and that alſo in a more eminent degree of perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Natura Naturata Intellectualis,</hi> whoſe being is mixt, viz. partly ſpirituall in relation to the Rationall ſoul, and partly Naturall in relation to the humane body and accordingly the perfections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature are partly Spirituall which are proper to the ſoul, and partly naturall which are proper to the body. And therefore they have both ſpiritual underſtandings and wils which are Eſſential to the rational ſoul, and capable of ſpirituall and Celeſtiall objects, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge, and naturall Inclination, whereby they judge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are proper unto natural Agents, and that alſo more exactlie then the naturall Agents themſelves are able to doe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Natura Naturata Naturalis.</hi> Whoſe being is meerly naturall, and accordingly their perfection is meerly Naturall, and therefore their Analogicall underſtandings and wils are onely verſ't in naturall objects, for though there be three degrees of naturall agents, (viz. 1. Senſitive, which is the moſt noble kind of all naturall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, becauſe they participate of ſenſe and appetite, which do moſt reſemble the faculties of underſtanding and wil in man. 2. <hi>Vegetative,</hi> which is in the ſecond degree of Excellencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (though they want ſenſe and appetite, yet) they participate of ſome naturall light and inclination, whereby they know and deſire things which concern their vitall being, nouriſhment, &amp; augmentation.</p>

               </gap> naturall which participate onely of a naturall light and inclination to direct and excite them unto their naturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per actions and motions) yet none of them do ever reach unto any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall or ſpirituall matters, either in their knowledge or inclinations: but onely unto naturall and corporeall objects. Now this <hi>Jus Divinum Creativum</hi> (in regard it concerneth the creatures onely in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall <hi>eſse</hi> and Reception of a being) cannot properlie claime any place in Government which concerneth the creatures onelie in their perpetuation and continuance.</p>

And theſe were the native and <hi>Divine</hi> Degrees and Orders obſerved in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world at the firſt creation, wherein the Lord himſelf was the King and <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> Angels (whoſe Superlative perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did conſtitute them in the higheſt degree and rank of creatures) were as the great Councell and Nobility of this King, and Gods ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Captaine Lieutenants in this great Armie of creatures. Men (whoſe perfections were of a middle rank and degree) were as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrates and gentry of this great King, and the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate officers in this great Army of creatures. And naturall Agents (whoſe mean and low condition and quality made them Incapable of any intereſt in the active part of Government, or of any power and command in Relation to the two former ſorts of creatures) were as the yeomanrie of this great King, and the body of this great Army of creatures. And therefore in all their externall Actions and Motions were ſubject and ſubordinate to the Orders and Commands, firſt of God, ſecondly of Angels, thirdly of men. But this <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> (by vertue whereof theſe admirable degrees of Order and Government were obſerved amongſt the creatures) was but of a ſhort continuance (as to the greateſt part thereof) for <hi>Beelzebub</hi> and his confederates preſently renounced their Alleagance to their King and Generall, and by their ſubtilties ſeduced all mankind from their duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby all of them became guiltie of high treaſon, and forfeited their Native and Originall Right and intereſt, in all the prerogatives and bleſſings which they held in <hi>Capite</hi> of this great King, and in all that power and authority wherewith they were inveſted by Commiſſion

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Vindicative Divine Right</hi> is that which is grounded upon the will of God concerning the Manifeſtation of his juſtice and equity in the preſervation of the creature in that adventitious ſtate of miſerie, whereinto it is elapſed by its voluntarie and ungratefull tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Divine Law, for the performance whereof he had enabled them in their native inveſtiture with thoſe Divine graces &amp; bleſſings which were requiſite thereunto. Which miſery of the creature doth conſiſt in the juſt and due puniſhment inflicted by God, for its moſt unjuſt and undue diſloyaltie and Rebellion. Which puniſhment is twofold, Spirituall, and Perſonall; 1 The Spirituall puniſhment is the Generall diſenablement of the creature for the performance of its native duty to its Creator, by the Generall deveſtment of the creature of all its native graces and bleſſings, in place whereof doth ſucceed the oppoſite and unnaturall curſes and privations which diſpoſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all manner of unnaturall wickedneſſe and rebellion againſt God. And this ſpirituall puniſhment in Devils is the Vniverſall depravitie of their wils, (whereby their native tranſcendent love of God, is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into the like proportion of hatred of God, and their tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent zeal to immitate God in doing good, to the like zeal to oppoſe God in doing evill.) And in men this ſpeciall puniſhment is the Vniverſall obſcurity of their underſtandings, and the Vniverſall depravitie of their wils.</p>

Whereby he contracts a greater guilt upon himſelfe then man doth in his diſobedience, who though he ſinne wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, both of his Originall and

Actuall ſinnes, are leſſe then the Devils, (in regard the Devils Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinnes did proceed immediately from his own wil, and mans part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Devils temptation. And the Devils Actuall ſinnes of perfect knowledge (and ſo are directly ſinnes againſt the holy Ghoſt) but mans partly of Ignorance) ſo ſhall mans judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation be leſſe ſevere and rigorous then the Devils.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſonall puniſhment is the torment and execution, whereof the creature is made ſenſible for the juſt puniſhment both of its Originall and Actuall delinquencies. And this conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz:</hi> a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a primitive part. The poſitive part is the <hi>paena ſenſus,</hi> ſo frequently inculcated by the Schol-men: for though ſpirits (as Devils and damned ſoules) cannot be ſenſible of paines in that manner as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are, yet doubtleſſe they ſhall be truly ſenſible of paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a higher nature, in that eternall fire of Hell prepared for the Devill and his Angels.

To be monuments of Gods infinite mercie and goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man-kind in this great work of Redemption by Chriſt, for whoſe ſake God hath reprinted ſome of the obliterated Characters of nature in the ſoul of every Intellectuall and naturall Agent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be Inſtruments and Miniſters of the good and benefit of Gods Elect, to whom alone the Spirituall grace and favour of God doth make theſe outward and materiall meanes, formally effectuall unto life and ſalvation. 3. To be witneſſes againſt themſelves at the day of judgement, for their inexcuſable Ingratitude in the Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their former diſloyalty and rebellion againſt God, after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of ſo generall and gracious a pardon of mercie, being notifyed unto all men in the common gifts and diſpenſations of the Spirit, the Characters whereof every man may find written in his heart, <hi>Rom. 2. v. 12.</hi> and that ſufficient to leave him without excuſe. <hi>Rom. 1.20.</hi> Now although theſe common gifts and graces of renewed nature in man, be moſt properly Spirituall and not Naturall, in regard all of them do proceed <hi>ab Extrinſeco</hi> from the Spirit of God, and none of them all <hi>ab Intrinſeco</hi> from the corrupted nature and Eſſence of man, for then they ſhould now be parallel and ſimiler in all men as they were in our firſt Parents, and had been alſo in all their poſterity, if they had perſiſted in their Originall Integrity. Whereas now we ſee they are diſtributed variouſly according to the good pleaſure of God, to ſome one ſort of gifts, to ſome another, and thoſe alſo in different degrees of perfection. For <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Hipocrates, and Galen,</hi> did much exceed moſt men in the perfection of their Intellectuals. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes, Cato, Fabritius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Scevola</hi> did much exceed others in the powerfulneſſe of command over their affections.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Hercules, Hector, Achilles, and Alexander</hi> did as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others in the Magnanimitie of their <hi>Heroick</hi> ſpirits, yet are theſe ſpirituall gifts uſually termed naturall (and that not without warrant of Scripture) in two reſpects. 1. In reſpect of the ſubject
<pb facs="tcp:114572:17"/>
which is the nature of the creature which by theſe common gifts and Graces of the Spirit is renewed in all men in ſome degree of perfection, though never in any unto that height of perfection wherein they were communicated unto men in their native and created ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before the fall. Noe not in the moſt abſolute knowing naturall men that ever lived, for we ſee with what great difficultie <hi>Ariſtotle and Plato</hi> (though the moſt learned amongſt the heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) attained to an Imperfect and obſcure knowledge of the <hi>eſſe,</hi> the Vnitie, and Eternitie of God. All which <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocencie clearly and punctually underſtood by nature. 2. Theſe common gifts and Graces of the Spirit are termed naturall in reſpect of their object, which is onely naturall and created Entities in their naturall and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated capacitie: Of which naturall things <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom. 8.1.2.</hi> But as for Chriſt the Mediatour and ground of the new Covenant of Grace, in regard he was no naturall creature, he could not poſſibly be the object of any naturall knowledge whether native or renewed. Nay the naturall knowledge of Angels themſelves could not reach him before it pleaſed God of his ſpeciall Grace and mercie to reveale him. For after God had compleated that Royall opifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of nature (his ſix dayes work) there was not ſuch a creature as Chriſt to be heard of amongſt all thoſe numerous and wonderfull varietyes of nature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could men or Angels poſſibly imagine how or by what meanes ſuch a perſon as Chriſt ſhould receive a being. For as Chriſt was not an ordinary work of nature, but a new miraculous work of mercie, ſo neither was the manner of his production naturall (either by Creation or generation) but ſupernaturall and Myſticall, by an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mbration of the Holy Ghoſt. And as the perſon and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt did tranſcend the knowledge both of men and Angels, ſo likewiſe did the offices of Chriſt, and all his Acts of Mediation and all thoſe Divine Graces (viz: Faith, Hope, Charitie) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it with a reall Right and intereſt therein. And therfore there was never one ſillable ſo much us muttered by any heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or other prophane writer concerning any of theſe, nor is it poſſible to attaine the leaſt glimps of knowledg concerning them by any other meanes, then the Immediate revelations of the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quaere.</hi> It may be demanded how theſe meer naturall gifts and bleſſings in heathens ſhould be a meanes of ſalvation, ſeeing no man by them can poſſibly attaine the knowledge of Chriſt, the ſole fountaine of
<pb facs="tcp:114572:17"/>
life: And therefore why heathen men ſhould be damned, to whom God never (ſince the publication of that Generall pardon by Chriſt) Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meanes to be ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Though theſe naturall gifts and bleſſings in heathens be not the direct and Immediate meanes to attaine the knowledge of Chriſt, yet they are the Remote and occaſionall meanes, becauſe they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lights to diſcover unto men the inſufficiencie of their owne abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to performe thoſe duties which the Law of God and nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth. And by that meanes to occaſion to ſeek for life and Salvation elſewhere; as the <hi>Aethiopian Eunuch did, and the converted Thiefe,</hi> who acknowledging his own unrighteouſneſſe ſought to Chriſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and (according to the rule of <hi>Petenti Dabitur</hi>) obtained what he ſought, though he never knew the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is but juſtice that thoſe heathens who doe not rightly imploy that one talent (which <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmeth they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.) ſhould receive their wages with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and ſloathfull ſervants, though theis woes ſhall not be equall to the woes of thoſe Caytiffes who have miſ-imployed five talents. viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The talent of naturall gifts and bleſſings, 2. The talent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Education, 3. The talent of Gods Word and Sacraments, 4. Of Religious Magiſtracie, 5. Of a learned Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is that which doth properly claime a place in that Government which concerneth heathen men without the boſome of the Church, and Ignorant of the will of God Revealed concerning Chriſt the Mediator.

And theſe are of two ſorts. 1. Such truthes wherein Chriſt hath expreſly made any of his love to us. And theſe againe are twofold, 1. Such as are the object of Chriſtian faith, and thoſe are ſuch things as Chriſt hath done and acted for our ſakes, for the Reconciliation of us to God, as the aſſumption of our nature, and the offering it up againe for a ſacrifice to God, and all other naturall acts of Mediation, which is the ſubſtance and contents of a Chriſtians Creed. 2. Such as are the object of Chriſtian hope, and thoſe are ſuch bleſſings as Chriſt by his act of Mediation hath made us capable of, and which for his ſake we expect by prayer to receive from God, and thoſe are the Supernaturall bleſſings and habits of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie;</hi> which enable us for the performance of our Chriſtian duties, and all thoſe Supernaturall bleſſings which are the reward of thoſe duties, and theſe are the ſubſtance and contents of our devotions. 2. The ſecond ſort of Supernaturall truths revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scriptures, are ſuch wherein we retaine an expreſſe of our love to Chriſt, proportionable to thoſe bleſſings which we have received of his love to us. And thoſe are ſuch truthes which are the object of our
<pb facs="tcp:114572:18"/>
Charity and rules of Chriſtian dutyes: of which truths Chriſt meant when he ſaid, <hi>If you know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Now theſe Chriſtian duties are of two ſorts, viz: either meerly or mixtly Evangelicall. 1. Meerly Evangelicall, are thoſe which conſiſt in the right uſe of <hi>Evangelical</hi> and Supernaturall gifts and bleſſings, ſuch as are the gifts of propheſying, healing, working of miracles, and the like mentioned by <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 12. which duties were of no uſe at all under the old Covenant of works, but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God ſince the fall of man for the benefit of his Church, and for helpes and furtherances to Chriſtian men in the performance of Chriſtian duties. 2. Mixtly <hi>Evangelical</hi> duties, are thoſe which conſiſt in the right uſe of Natural bleſſings, and which received their firſt ſanction from God in Paradiſe before the Apoſtaſie of man: upon which Apoſtaſie, that law of nature was abſolutely aboliſhed as to that uſe, to be a Rule and ground for the Salvation and damnation of man; For no man is now damned becauſe he tranſgreſſeth that law of nature, but becauſe of Infidelity, Deſpair, and hatred of Chriſt; which are the oppoſite vices to <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charitie,</hi> which conſiſt in the knowledge, confidence, and love of Chriſt, which that law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any way related unto.</p>
            <p>But yet the ſame law and Rule received a new <hi>Evangelical</hi> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God the Redeemer, who as he renewed the nature of man, ſo did he alſo renew the ſame law of nature for a new Evangelicall law and rule, whereby to meaſure theſe new Evangelicall duties, which are as neceſſarie to Salvation now under the Goſpel (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> proves 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) as the Legal duties were under the Law and old Covenant of works, which ſeverall duties are the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being meaſured by the ſame Law and Rule, but different in circumſtances. Firſt in their Objects. For whereas under the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, God the Creator was the adaequate and Immediate object of our love and duty: Now the Immediate and adaequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof is Chriſt the Redeemer, 2. Circumſtance wherein they differ, is in the manner of performance; which under the old Covenant was to be proportioned to the utmoſt exactneſſe of a moſt perfect Law, but now under the new, to the utmoſt exactneſſe onely of our moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect abilities. And this new <hi>Evangelical</hi> Law is that whereupon Chriſt will pronounce that fatal ſentence of Eternal life or death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men at the day of judgement, as himſelf affirmeth: <hi>Mat. 25.34.
<pb facs="tcp:114572:19"/>
Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you; will</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſay to them on his Right hand.</hi> Not becauſe they were Wiſe, or valiant, or Rich, or Noble, nor yet becauſe they had preached and wrought Miracles, and caſt out Devils, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in Chriſts name; but becauſe they had fed the hungry, clothed the naked, comforted the ſick, relieved the ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow. And therefore becauſe this new Commandment of Charity, which is the ground of theſe duties, is of ſo neceſſary concernment for the Salvation of all men: The Holy Ghoſt did alwayes expreſſe thoſe practical truths which relate to Charity in plain Grammatical words and precepts, as wel before as after Chriſts Incarnation, whereas theſe ſpeculative truths, which are the Object of our Faith, and theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings alſo which are the proper Object of our Hope, were commonly repreſented unto the Church in the old Teſtament by Types and Figures.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>S. Paul</hi> in diſputing this point of Faith and works in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the <hi>Galatians,</hi> concludes Faith alone to be ſufficient to Salvation; and excludes works as Impediments rather then helpes thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> There be three ſorts of works grounded upon three ſeverall Lawes. 1. Ceremoniall works which were grounded upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law which was abrogated by Chriſt, and theſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludes as altogether unprofitable. 2. Legal workes, which were grounded upon the Law of Nature, which was the ground of the old Covenant of works. And theſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> excludes as altogether Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. 3. Evangelicall works which are grounded upon that new Law, which Chriſt preſcribed, <hi>Iohn. 13.34. A new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give I you, that you love one another.</hi> Which new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be underſtood of that Love which was the complement of that law which was the ground of the old Cov. of works, for that was an old Commandment given by God at the firſt Creation, before Chriſt was thought on either by man or Angels, but muſt neceſſarily concern this Evangelical love and Charity which relateth to Chriſt the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and is the Complement of this new Evangelical Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this new Covenant of Grace is grounded. And theſe Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call works are as neceſſary to Salvation as either Faith or Hope, from which it cannot poſſibly be ſeparated, as is evident in the converted Thief. For I am ſure the Salvation of that Thief was atchieved by
<pb facs="tcp:114572:19"/>
as great a mercy from God, and as little merit in himſelfe, as could be expected in any man that is ſaved. For we never read of any grace that he had, or any good work that he did, till he was upon the Gallows; when the ſhortneſſe of his life could not afford opportunity for many: and yet in that ſhort hiſtorie of his ſhort life, we ſhall find a record of his Charity, as well as of his Faith and Hope: For in the firſt place he rebuked his blaſphemous companion, there was an act of his Charity; Secondly, he juſtified Chriſts innocencie, and acknowledged his power and donimion, there was an act of his Faith; Thirdly, he prayed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſing of life by Chriſt, there was an act of his Hope, <hi>Luk. 13.39.</hi> And therefore by reaſon of the inſeparable connexion of theſe three Evangelicall Graces, the holy Ghoſt doth ſometimes attribute ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to one of them alone, but that is in oppoſition to all Ceremonies or legall duties and perfections, but never in oppoſition to any one of the other two concomitant graces of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Before I paſſe from this point of Charity, I ſhall crave the Readers leave to digreſſe a little in the recommendation of her reſults, (ariſing from the circumſtances obſervable in Chriſts new Commandment of Charity) to the obſervation of our new Phariſaicall Goſpellers, who diſdaine all men of a different perſwaſion from themſelves as Heathens and Publicans.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Traitor <hi>Judas</hi> was amongst the twelve when Chriſt gave them this <hi>new Commandment</hi> to <hi>love one another:</hi> &amp; therfore it was never Chriſts intent to prohibit communication in publique and Chriſtian duties with any who did publiquely profeſſe themſelves mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Church, unleſſe where the parties obſtinately either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in ſuch hereticall opinions as are manifeſtly deſtructive to the grounds and principles of Chriſtian faith: Or elſe obſtinately perſiſt in ſuch notorious and ſcandalous courſes of life, as publickly declare them void of Chriſtian Charity. For after this Commandement, Chriſt himſelfe did adminiſter the Sacrament of his bodie and blood to <hi>Judas,</hi> as appeares <hi>Luk. 22.</hi> although Chriſt himſelfe was not then ignorant that <hi>Judas</hi> intended to betray him that night.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not amongst the twelve when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them <hi>to love one another,</hi> though he was then a Choſen veſſell, and <hi>Judas</hi> then a Reprobate. And therefore Chriſt did never priviledge us to Judge or Condemne any man (much leſſe to injure or defraud any man under pretence that he is a Reprobate, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb facs="tcp:114572:20"/>
to God) for ſuch preſumptuous Intruſions into the Councells and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of God, is an Idolatrous Arrogancie, which the very Angells of God dare not adventure upon. For what man could have judged Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to be a member of Chriſt, at eleven of the clock that day which was the day of his converſion, when he was poſting to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> with ſtrong Commiſſion from the high Prieſt, and a ſtronger Reſolution in himſelfe to perſecute all people of all ſexes, who profeſſed Chriſt, <hi>Acts 9.</hi> And when Chriſt told the twelve of that abominable treaſon which ſhould be acted that night againſt himſelfe by one of them, the eleven no more ſuſpected <hi>Judas</hi> then they did one another, as appeares <hi>John 13.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And therefore ſeeing theſe high Saints could not determine either of the ſalvation of <hi>Paul,</hi> or damnation of <hi>Judas;</hi> no not ſix houres before the Lord himſelf publickly declared his own determinations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame unto the world, What a prodigious and horrid pride and arrogancy is it in the petty Saints of our fanatick age, to paſſe a definitive ſentence in theſe points upon their Brethren? I could willingly permit my pen to expatiate in the further Illuſtration of Evangelicall Graces and Immunities (to reſolve the doubts, and prevent the miſtakes of many poore deluded Soules, who onely underſtand, or rather indeed do only miſunderſtand, ſufficient concerning the ſame, to be a ground for the erection of many erroneous and prodigious phantaſies and Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's) if the point were as pertinent to my purpoſe as to theſe times. But my Reſolution is with all ſtudiouſneſſe to avoid impertinent digreſſions in this diſcourſe. Now this <hi>Jus Divinum ſupernaturale</hi> although it concerne Chriſtian men within the verge of the Church, yet in regard it doth concerne them onely in their Chriſtian and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vocation as members of Chriſts viſible Church, doth not properly and Immediately claime a place in Politick Government which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth men as members of a politick ſociety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Naturall Divine Right</hi> is that which is grounded upon the will of God revealed in the Scriptures concerning thoſe Naturall truthes which are the Remote and mediate meanes of Salvation by Chriſt, of which truthes Chriſtians and Heathens are equally capable by nature, and whereof <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency participated in full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſince his Apoſtaſie the ſame are renew'd unto all men in ſome proportion, yea even unto the moſt ignorant and ſavage Indians: but yet are made more cleare and manifeſt unto Chriſtians by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture (in thoſe particulars which the holy Ghoſt hath jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:114572:20"/>
neceſſary to communicate for the benefit of the Church.) And this <hi>Jus Divinum Naturale</hi> is twofold: <hi>Implicitum</hi> &amp; <hi>Explicitum.</hi> But I ſhall referre the more punctuall diſcuſſion of this <hi>Jus Divinum <label type="milestone">

               <p>Government <hi>is the Adminiſtration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that power and authoritie which the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hath over the Inferiour;</hi> Where we may obſerve that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is a word of Relation, which, by the rules of Logick, neceſſarily requires a <hi>Correlatum,</hi> and that is ſubjection, each of them being grounded upon ſeverall qualities, the former upon Power and Authority, the latter upon Submiſſion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the one of which cannot exiſt without the other: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before the Creation whilſt there was nothing in being but one onely God (whoſe unity could not admit of any degrees of Superiority or ſubordination) there could be no manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or ſubjection.

or in perfection and excellencie equall, or in power and authoritie parallel himſelfe; ſo that the very firſt creatures which God made, which (by reaſon of the Independancie of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance upon any other creatures) I ſuppoſe were the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels (for the Rule and Method which God obſerved in the work of Creation, was to frame that laſt, whoſe ſubſiſtance depended upon the former, and that firſt which had no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancie upon the latter) being inferiour unto God both in glorie and power, became ſubject unto his guidance, rule, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as likewiſe all the reſt of the Creatures did as ſoon as they received a being from him, whoſe Actions and motions were altogether ordered and diſpoſed by his wiſdome and providence.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the diverſe kind of Government, and firſt of Internall.</head>
               <p>BUt that we may further Illuſtrate the nature of Order and Government in generall, it will be requiſite to take a view of the ſeverall Species or kinds of Government the firſt and Immediate diviſion wherof is into Internall and externall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Internall Regiment <hi>is the Adminiſtration and excerciſe of that Power and Authoritie which God hath over the Intrinſecall Acts and Effects emanating immediately from the forme and Eſſence of the Creature:</hi> (which forme in man we know to be the ſoul, and in all other creatures an Intrinſecall form Anologicall to the ſoul in man.)</p>
               <p>And this kind of Regiment is proper and peculiar unto God alone, and in no ſort communicable unto any creature whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for <hi>the knowledge and triall of the heart and Reines is</hi> a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative which the <hi>Lord</hi> doth claime entirely to himſelfe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. And therefore in relation to this Internall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114572:22"/>
our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelfe doth expreſly inhibit his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.9. <hi>to call any man father upon earth, for (ſaith he) you have one Father which is in Heaven,</hi> to whom alone that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and inward honour which reacheth the very thoughts and cogitations of the heart is properly due. And in the ſame ſenſe alſo he Interdicts them the Arrogation of the title of Rabbi or Maſter in the ſubſequent verſe of the ſame Chapter, becauſe that kind of rule and maſterſhip over the Intrinſecall thoughts and conceipts of the mind, or the inward deſires and affections of the heart would be an uſurpation upon Chriſts own right and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, even as he is God Omniſcient and Omnipotent, and the ſame with the Father. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the diſcuſſion of a caſe of Conſcience concerning meats offered unto Idols maketh this more plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>Though there be many (ſaith he) that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods and Lords, by reaſon of an externall and worldly</hi> power and preheminence over the externall and corporeall actions of thoſe who are under their Juriſdiction and Government: yet to us (ſaith he) us, who are Spirituall, and whoſe profeſſion relates principally to the Intrinſecall affaires and acts of the ſoul and conſcience) <hi>there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> who hath any Right or Power to judge us, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters pertaining onely to the ſoul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>A further confirmation of all which we have in the extent of that obedience which the Moral Law preſcribeth, beyond the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience exacted by any humane lawes, of what qualitie ſoever they be, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill, or by what wiſdome ſoever they be compoſed, whether Divine or Humane. For even when God himſelfe did inſtitute both the ſorts of humane Lawes in the Mount, and commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to write them (for a perfect rule of worſhip and policie to the Iſraelites, and for a perfect pattern for all other Nations, whereby to frame a Government both in their Eccleſiaſticall and Civill affaires) he therein taught onely the Orderings and Regulating of their outward actions, which the Eccleſiaſticall and Civill Magiſtrate (to whom the execution of theſe Lawes pertained) were able to judge of, proportioning the extent of theſe humane Lawes, according to the extent of that Government, which he was pleaſed to communicate unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114572:23"/>
humane creatures, whom he doth conſtitute and ordaine his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Duputies for the externall Government of this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and Sublunarie world: And therefore doth refer the execution of all humane Lawes unto them, yea even that part alſo of his Morall Law which relates to outward actions. For indeed the Ceremoniall and Judiciall Lawes of <hi>Moſes</hi> are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but (as it were) Commentaries upon that part of the firſt and ſecond Table of the ten Commandments, which relates to outward actions, ſetting down more ample and particular rules of inſtruction, whereby to order and regulate the outward actions of Publicke Societies in matters concerning worſhip and policy, according as the Morall Law had done in briefe and generall termes, for regulating the externall actions of every private man in particular, in relation to the ſame end. But when the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God did compoſe that compleate and abſolute Law, which ſhould be a Rule for his owne Immediate Government and our Univerſal obedience, he therein preſcribeth us <hi>directions,</hi> (not onely for outward actions, of which alſo he is the Supreame <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> as I ſhall demonſtrate hereafter, but even) for the moſt ſecret and inward deſires and cogitations of the heart, whereof he is the ſole and entire Judge and Ruler: all which is more fully declared by <hi>Moſes</hi> (who received that Law Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the hand of God himſelf) in his expoſition thereof <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> thus Comments upon the firſt Table. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Lord thy God,</hi> 1. <hi>with all thy heart,</hi> this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an obligation upon the will and affections to ſubmit to the commands of God, expreſſed in the firſt Table of the Morall Law. 2. <hi>With all the ſoul.</hi> This extends the ſame obligation to the underſtanding. 3. <hi>With all thy might and ſtrength.</hi> This liſts all the outward members of the body under the ſame command. Yea and our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who beſt knew the intent and ſcope of his Fathers Law, affirmes this brief expoſition to be the very ſumme &amp; ſubſtance of the firſt and greateſt Commandment. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.31. In which text our <hi>Saviour</hi> likewiſe reciteth <hi>Moſes</hi> his brief Commentarie upon the ſecond table expreſſed in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18. in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> which ſecond Commandment Chriſt affirmes to be the very ſumme and ſubſtance of the ſecond Table, exacting an obedience parallel to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114572:23"/>
that which is mentioned in the firſt) by this ſhort but ſweet &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual expreſſion <hi>(as thy ſelf)</hi> which preſcribes the proportion of that affection which muſt be exhibited to our neighbour. Now we al know by experience, that ſelf-love cannot be confined within the narrow limits of outward reſpects, but hath its conſtant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon both the heart and ſoul, &amp; every faculty thereof, as wel as upon the outward members of the body. Nay this Internall obedience (which relates to that Internall Government which is peculiar unto God himſelf) is the onely acceptable ſacrifice unto God, and that which he accounts his chiefeſt honour and glory, and wherein he would never admit of a partner; for it was never known ſince the Creation of the world, that ever God Imported this power and command over the heart and ſoul unto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, though never ſo dear a Saint and favourite. Godly <hi>Samuel</hi> mourned greatly for wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> but had not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make him good. 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 15.35. Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> perceived the pernitious and deſtructive folly of his onely ſonne <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but had not power by reforming his underſtanding to prevent the miſchievous effects which enſued thereof. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliſha</hi> foreſaw, foretold, and lamented with teares (even unto <hi>Hazael</hi> himſelf) the horrid and inhumane crueltie which <hi>Hazael</hi> ſhould afterwards practiſe upon the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet could not by that Patheticall premonition prevent <hi>Hazaels</hi> future fury and dogedneſſe unto them; although at the preſent <hi>Hazael</hi> ſeemed to abhorr the very thought of ſuch Inhumanities. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.12.13. Nay our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> in the parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> expreſly affirmeth, that though a Saint ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven to preach and admoniſh Impenitent and wicked men, yet could not his words be effectuail for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or to ſecure them from <hi>theſe flames wherein Dives was tormented;</hi> If the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf did not effect it by that word of truth <hi>which Moſes and the Prophets had</hi> left upon Record for that very purpoſe. <hi>For Paul may plant</hi> by Miracles and Documents, <hi>Apollos may water</hi> by Learning and Eloquence, but <hi>God alone muſt give the increaſe</hi> of ſincere and ſaving Faith and repentance. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Onely it pleaſed Almighty God to Inveſt his own dear Sonne with this Royall Prerogative, giving all things and all power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114572:24"/>
over all creatures into his hands, and ſuch a Kingdome and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as ſhould have no end. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke.</hi> 1 32.33. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.3. Which places as likewiſe all other places of Scripture which attribute any Sovereignty or Dominion unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are to be underſtood onely of this Internall government: for of all externall and worldly power and authority, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly declined and diſclaimed the adminiſtration and exerciſe, reproving the giddineſs and precipitancy of the peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who would have obtruded the honour of a King upon him, when they were tranſported with admiration of his miracles, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of five thouſand men with five loaves and two fiſhes. <hi>John.</hi> 6.15. <hi>For his kingdome</hi> (as himſelf acknowledged to <hi>Pilat) was not of this world,</hi> and therefore he taught his Diſciples by his own example to eſchew the affection of that kind of power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>which the Kings of the Gentiles exerciſed over their people,</hi> leaving them a perfect preſident of meekneſſe and humility in himſelf, <hi>by taking upon himſelf the form,</hi> and practiſing the duties of a ſervant, not diſdaining <hi>to waſh the very feet of his Diſciples. John.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Whereby it is evident to whom the propriety of Intereſt and title to this Internall Regiment of Right appertaineth; and upon a further ſcrutiny and inquiſition concerning particulars, it will appear that the practiſe thereof hath alwaies gone accordingly, and the actuall adminiſtration and exerciſe of all power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Intrinſecall Acts and Effects of the ſoul, hath alwaies been the peculiar priviledge and prerogative of God. But for an Introduction hereunto, it will be requiſite to premiſe the ſeverall ſorts of diviſions and Subdiviſions which are Incident to this Internall Regiment, by reaſon of the various circumſtances whereunto it doth relate with one <hi>Objectum, modus, media &amp; finis.</hi> 1. The firſt Circumſtance is the object or matter whereupon God doth exerciſe his power, and that is upon the Intrinſecall acts and effects of the ſoul. 2. Circumſtance is the manner how God doth exerciſe his power upon theſe acts and effects of the ſoul. 3. The meanes whereby God doth exerciſe his power upon theſe acts and effects of the ſoul. 4. The end for which God doth, in this or that manner, by this or that meanes, exerciſe his power upon theſe Intrinſecall acts and effects of the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114572:24"/>1. The firſt diviſion then of this Internall Regiment is taken from the diverſitie of the object or matter thereof: <hi>viz:</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall acts and effects of the ſoul, which are differenced by vertue of the different faculties from whence they proceed, which are, the underſtanding, and the will, each of whoſe acts do likewiſe admit of a <hi>Subdiviſion,</hi> by reaſon of the diverſitie of the ſubordinate object or matter whereunto they relate, which may be either <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>temporall</hi> matters. So that from this firſt diviſion and Subdiviſion do ariſe theſe four kinds of Internall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. 1. That kind which reſpects the underſtanding in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Spiritual</hi> matters. 2. That which reſpects the ſame in reference to <hi>temporall</hi> matters. 3. That kind which reſpects the will in reference to <hi>Spirituall</hi> matters. 4. That which reſpects the ſame in reference to <hi>temporall</hi> matters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe every one of theſe four ſorts of Internall Regiment (being conſidered in relation to the manner how <hi>God</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his power upon the Intrinſecall acts and effects of the Soul) are capable of a ſecond <hi>Subdiviſion,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> doth work upon the ſeverall acts and effects both of the will and underſtanding after a two-fold manner: upon the underſtanding, either by way of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, or by way of Infatuation; upon the will, either by way of Obduration, or by way of Mollification and converſion, by vertue of which ſeverall ſorts of operation upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will, Theſe four kinds of Internall Regiment above mentioned may be Subdivided into eight ſubalternate ſpecies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Againe every one of theſe eight ſorts of Internall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may yet be <hi>Subdivided</hi> in reference to the meanes whereby <hi>God</hi> doth work upon all theſe ſeverall objects, after all thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes: for either <hi>God</hi> doth operate immediately by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and extraordinary meanes of his Spirit, or mediately by the common and ordinary meanes of the Creature: Each of which meanes being applicable to every one of the eight ſpecies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Regiment before recited, may branch out thoſe eight ſpecies into ſixteen particulars.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the laſt Circumſtance to which this Internall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth relate. <hi>viz.</hi> The end for which <hi>God</hi> doth exerciſe his power upon the Intrinſecall acts and effects of the ſoul, I conceive it doth rather qualify then multiply the ſeveall ſpecies or kinds
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114572:25"/>
of Internall Regiment: for the end is the very reaſon and cauſe wherefore, and the very rule and ſquare whereby <hi>God</hi> doth by this or that meanes, in this or that manner exerciſe his power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeverall acts and effects, either of the underſtanding or the will, whether it be in <hi>Spirituall</hi> or in <hi>temporall</hi> matters. And this end being primarily his own glory, It is the very <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> which giveth motion and action to all the wheeles of <hi>Gods</hi> providence: for as in all other reaſonable Agents, ſo in <hi>God</hi> the moſt reaſonable; The end is <hi>Primum Intentione</hi> (though <hi>ultimum executione</hi>) and that which incites his will to every action. Now <hi>Gods</hi> glory as it reſpects humane creatures (of which we now ſpeak, as being the object wherein both the nature and parts of <hi>Gods</hi> internall Regiment are made moſt conſpicuous to us) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted two waves. Firſt by his mercy. Secondly by his juſtice: which two do conſtitute two ſeverall ends of <hi>Gods</hi> internall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt the manifeſtation of his mercy and goodneſſe in the exhibition of bleſſings and benefits to the godly, Secondly, The manifeſtation of his power and greatneſſe in the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of curſes and judgements upon the wicked. And therefore whereſoever we find any particular acts of <hi>Gods</hi> internall Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in any of all the forementioned kinds thereof) recorded in Scripture (as indeed there is no one kind amongſt all the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſeverall ſorts whereinto it is diſtinguiſhed, but <hi>God</hi> hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome one or other occaſion left us an expreſſe from his own Spirit to evidence his Right and Title thereunto, <hi>materia, modo, &amp; medijs predictis,</hi> as I ſhall demonſtrate in the next place) there we ſhall find likewiſe one of theſe two ends recorded for the ground and cauſe of that particular act of Government and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaſt the reader ſhould imagine theſe diviſions and Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Internall Government to be ſome meer <hi>Logicall</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> Notions, it will not be Impertinent by inſtances in particular acts of <hi>Gods</hi> providence, relating to every perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kind of Internall Government, to demonſtrate all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid diviſions to be expreſly grounded upon the word of <hi>God.</hi> And becauſe the firſt eight of the foreſaid <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Internall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment relate unto the underſtanding, the latter eight <hi>ſpecies</hi> unto the will; I ſhall (for a more diſtinct and Methodicall proceeding

               <p>Now as concerning Gods actuall adminiſtration of Power and Authority in ordering and regulating the acts and effects of the will of man (whether by way of obduration and perſeverance in evill, as in <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchad-nezzer,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar.</hi> Or by way of mollification and converſion unto good, as in <hi>Manaſſes, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>) the Maximes of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> (decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the neceſſary dependance of the will upon the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the irreſiſtable power of the underſtanding over the acts and effects of the will, by enforcing (as it were) the will to embrace or refuſe whatſoever the underſtanding ſhall propoſe unto the will, under the notion of a good or evill, truly eligible or avoidable) do ſo plainly demonſtrate all the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the will of man in every reſpect, both of matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and meanes, to be the right and prerogative of God (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his abſolute power and command over the underſtanding which is the maſter and guide of the will) that I conceive it not pertinent to produce any expreſſes of Scripture, (though it be plentifull in inſtances to that purpoſe) to evidence a truth ſo clear
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114572:27"/>
and obvious. For I deſire to avoid prolixity where the perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie of the matter doth rather recommend brevity to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhould conclude this chapter of Internal Regiment and the parts thereof, and enter upon a Polemicall diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome important doubts ariſing from the premiſes. But that our former diviſion (extending the power and authority of God unto the Intrinſecall acts and effects iſſuing from the form and eſſence of all other creatures as well as of men) doth require that for method ſake we ſhould in this place ſpeak a word or two of the actuall adminiſtration and exerciſe thereof, both in Supernaturall and naturall Agents. As for the abſoluteneſſe of Gods power and command over the acts and effects of Angels, our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelf is a ſufficient witneſſe thereof, teaching his Diſciples <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. to pray that their obedience here in earth, might be parallel to the obedience which is performed to God in Heaven. And the <hi>prophet David</hi> maketh it the very property of the Angels in Heaven to <hi>fulfill the Commandments of God, and to hearken unto the voice of his words.</hi> Pſa. 103.20.</p>
               <p>Neither are the Devils leſſe ſubject unto the commands of God, as appeares by their attendance thereupon, concerning the triall of <hi>Iob, Ch.</hi> 1. and the ſeducing of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. their worſhipping of Chriſt, and proclaiming him to be <hi>the Sonne of the moſt High God. Mar.</hi> 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.28. And by that teſtimony which the evil ſpirit poſſeſſing the Damſel of <hi>Thyatyra</hi> gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the callings and Doctrine of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas: Act.</hi> 16.16. And by the different reſpects of the evil ſpirit unto the adjurations of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the ſeven ſonnes of <hi>Scaeva: Act.</hi> 19. And as for Gods actual Adminiſtration of power and authority over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall acts of the natural Agents, the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrate it, in recording the readineſs of many of them to execute the commands of God, even in ſuch particular acts as are no way ſutable to their natural Inclinations: as in <hi>Ravens</hi> to feed <hi>Elijah:</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. In the <hi>whales</hi> attendance to receive <hi>Jonah</hi> and tranſport him ſafe to dry land: <hi>Jonah Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. In that fire which exerciſed its natural heat and fury upon the Kings Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and yet altogether reſtrained the ſame towards the three children: <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And thoſe hungry Lyons which would not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114572:27"/>
touch <hi>Daniel</hi> in a whole nights ſpace, yet devoured his accuſers in an inſtant: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Dub.</note>THE ſubject of that Polemical diſcourſe, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the laſt Chapter to be grounded upon the premiſes, is a quaere concerning the cauſality of ſinne, which our former proofes and aſſertions do ſeem to faſten altogether upon God, by inveſting him with the ſole and total power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie over both the underſtanding and will of man, in reference to all their Intrinſecall acts, of what ſort or kind ſoever they be, or in what manner, or by what meanes ſoever they be performed, from whence undoubtedly do proceed all manner of ſinnes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſinnes againſt the truth and verity of God, as <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> which are acts of the Infatuated underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: or againſt the juſtice and Sanctity of God, which are acts and effects of the vitated and obdurate will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Schoolmen are much perplexed to ſteer an equall courſe (in the ſolution of this doubt) between the goodneſs and the Omnipotency of God. And out of a ſeeming ſolicitude to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the <hi>Charibdis</hi> of impiety which makes God acceſsory to the leaſt circumſtance of ſinne, they fall into that <hi>Scylla</hi> of Hereſie, which makes man maſter of his own will, conceiving that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch freedome of will, man could not be capable of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent guilt, to render God ſufficiently innocent: and ſo out of an ignorant and impious zeal to defend and Vindicate the Honour of God in relation to his goodneſs and Sanctity, they dangerouſly wound the ſame in derogating from his Power &amp; Omnipotency.</p>
               <p>But the examination and confutation of theſe Scholaſtical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies would be too great a digreſſion from my purpoſe, and therefore I ſhall ſeek no other ſolution for this doubt, then what the Scriptures themſelves ſuggeſt: which preſents all Moral actions under a capacity of the two oppoſite qualifications of good and evill, the former proceeding from the principal, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114572:28"/>
latter from the Inſtrumentall Agent: and therefore the former muſt of neceſſity be a Poſitive and Eſsentiall propertie of every humane action, whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> relate to the underſtanding or the wil, becauſe (as we have already prooved) both of them are wholly guided and ordered by the wiſdome and providence of God, the principall Agent. For which cauſe, even the moſt ſinfull and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions are good in their ſubſtance and eſsence, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually tend to the manifeſtation of Gods glory, either as acts of mercy to the Godly (in whom ſinne produceth puniſhment, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment repentance, repentance Faith, Faith the favour of God, and the favour of God life and Salvation) or as acts of juſtice to the wicked (in whom ſinne produceth puniſhment, puniſhment hardneſſe of heart, hardneſſe of heart Incredulity, Incredulity hatred of God, and hatred of God death and deſtruction) all which is manifeſt in the different effects which ſinne produced in <hi>Godly David,</hi> and in <hi>wicked Pharaoh. Davids</hi> murder and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery occaſioned many reproofes and corrections from God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22. And theſe corrections and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wrought ſorrow and repentance in <hi>Davids</hi> heart. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 5. that repentance faith and truſt in God. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 30. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 31. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 52. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23. That faith and truſt obtained love and favour from God. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 27. And that love and favour an aſsured hope of life and Salvation. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12. Again, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> oppreſſions provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God to ſend his judgements and plagues upon him: Thoſe plagues and judgements hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart: That hardneſs of heart cauſed incredulity: And that incredulity the hatred of God: and that hatred occaſioned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ruine and deſtruction in the Red Sea. All which appeares in the firſt fourteen Chapters of the book of <hi>Exodus:</hi> Yea the goodneſs of God, made the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drunkeneſs and inceſt of <hi>Lot,</hi> the enſuing Inceſt of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the malice of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the treaſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the injuſtice of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> the happy and bleſsed meanes of life and ſalvation to man. Yea even <hi>Adams</hi> fall, the Original cauſe and fountaine of epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall corruption, ſinne, and miſery in man, was by the wiſdome and providence of God, made a meanes of greater glory and happineſs to the godlie,<note place="margin">Seotus.</note> then his perſeverance and continuance in innocencie could have been. For (as the wittieſt of the Scoolmen moſt wittilie argueth) if life had been given as a reward of our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114572:28"/>
juſt works; the reward muſt have been proportioned according to the work, and our works being finite, could not have merited the infinite joyes of Heaven for their reward: the injoyment and fruition whereof for one minute, would have farr exceeded the proportion of the merits of our works; whereas life Eternall and the Infinite joyes of Heaven being now conferred upon the faithfull and elect children of God, not by way of debt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe of merits, but by the free grace and mercy of God; this Infinite gift is proportioned, not according to the meane and invalid merits of the receiver, but according to the Infinite and unvaluable grace and mercy of the <hi>Donor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay it is moſt certaine, that all ſinnes in the <hi>Saints</hi> do through Gods wiſdome and providence become a meanes to increaſe their ſanctification and glory, in the wickd to increaſe their woe and condemnation, in both to increaſe the glory of God, and are in all theſe reſpects perfectly and purely good. But yet we do not deny but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do record all theſe for tranſgreſſions of the Law of God, and do thereupon paſs ſentence of death and damnation upon all thoſe who do ſuch things, or are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſuch evils; But then we affirme, all this obliquity and irregularity (which addes this ſecondary and accidentall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to theſe actions) not to be any thing <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> to the action, but a caſuall and Extrinſecall defect, occaſioned by ſome malignity in the meanes whereby, or ſome imperfection in the object whereupon God doth work in theſe irregular actions; All which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> maketh more plain, <hi>James</hi> 1.13. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) is not tempted of evill</hi> (all his intentions and actions are good,) But then comes the evill when mans luſt or wrath (by the temptation and inſtigation of the <hi>Devill</hi>) interveneth and entiſeth man to <hi>filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe;</hi> And from this malignity in the <hi>Devill,</hi> and corruption in our ſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a conſtant deficiencie in reſpect of ſome circumſtance, which entitles all our actions (even the moſt upright and beſt) unto ſome Degree of ſinfulneſs and irregularity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> But then hence again you will inferre, that the actuall adminiſtration of Gods Power over the underſtanding and will of man is not abſolute in relation to every circumſtance; For that which is already ſpoken makes it plain out of Saint <hi>James,</hi> that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114572:29"/>
partly the <hi>Devill,</hi> and partly our own luſts have a ſhare in the guidance and government of all our actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It is true they have a ſhare, but not in the ſubſtance of the action, but in ſome accidentall and Extrinſecall circumſtance, and in that alſo not as principal, but as inſtrumentall Agents onely, being ordered and regulated by a ſuperior Agent, even in that very vitiouſneſs whereby they work, and from whence all evil actions derive their denomination, God ſo reſtraining or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the courſe and fury of their vitiouſneſs and irregularity, that it ſhall work its effects in the action, onely to ſuch a Degree of evil, as may ſerve beſt for Gods own end and purpoſe therein. As we may obſerve in the <hi>Devils</hi> malice againſt <hi>Iob, Ch.</hi> 1. And <hi>Labans</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob: Gen.</hi> 32.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God made all ſorts of creatures whatſoever abſolutely good and perfect in their kind, and according to ſuch a Degree and meaſure of perfection as was moſt ſutable to their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and thoſe ends for which God created them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Angels</hi> as they exceeded all other creatures in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Nature, &amp; eminency of thoſe high offices to which God had appointed them, ſo did they alſo far exceed all others in the excellency and eminency of their perfection and goodneſs; But yet all this was but a created and dependant perfection in <hi>Angels,</hi> it was not ſuch an abſolute Eſsentiall and inſeperable perfection as God himſelf is poſſeſt of, and which ſhould exempt them from the acts of Gods continuall and everlaſting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: For all creatures (becauſe creatures) have ſtill a dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon their <hi>Creator,</hi> not onely in their actions, but even in their very being and exiſtence: And therefore the wiſdome of God (to demonſtrate his own perfection and glory to be abſolute and Eſſentiall, the creatures onely dependant and of an accidentall continuance, <hi>durante ſuo beneplacito</hi>) left both men and <hi>Angels</hi> (at the inſtant of their fall) unto themſelves, not abſolutely, (for then they muſt have been abſolutely Annihilated.) But in ſuch a meaſure as God himſelfe thought fit to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the greatneſs of their fall, (even as a Nurſe doth ſometimes partly let ſlip the childes ſleeve, purpoſely to make it underſtand the better who ſupports it, that it may not grow too proud and confident of its own ſtrength) for no ſooner had God thus deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Angels,</hi> but their Univerſal ſelf-inſufficiency &amp; impotency appeared; For whereas a principal part of their office and ſervice appointed them by God, was the Admiration and praiſe of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114572:30"/>
Excellency and Omnipotency and Glory of God in all his works, theſe <hi>Angels</hi> Immediately upon this deſertion, diverting their thoughts from Gods glory and excellency, fixed the ſame upon their own; And forgetting God their <hi>Creator,</hi> began to Deifie themſelves his creatures: which was their ſinne, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ruine: Which ought to be an Everlaſting Caution both to men and <hi>Angels</hi> not to Deifie, or place any idolatrous truſt or confidence in any created Entitie, although beautified and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Angelicall</hi> and <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> perfection and glory.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Externall Regiment, wherein Firſt of Miraculous Regiment.</head>
               <p>HAving finiſhed the tract of Internall Regiment, my method in the next place preſents the delineation of Externall; wherein I ſhall not varie from my former Order, declaring firſt the nature and Originall, Secondly the parts thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Externall Regiment</hi> is the oppoſite ſpecies to <hi>Internall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Internall</hi> by the difference of its object, for whereas the object of <hi>Internall Regiment</hi> was the Intrinſecall acts of the ſoul, the object of <hi>Externall</hi> is the Extrinſecall acts of the body or <hi>Externall</hi> ſubſtance; ſo that <hi>Externall Regiment</hi> may be appoſitely thus defined. Externall Regiment is <hi>the exerciſe and Adminiſtration of that Power and Authority which the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Agent hath over the Externall actions and motions of the ſubſtance or Externall members of the Inferior.</hi> Which <hi>Externall</hi> actions and motions are guided and Governed immediately by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall acts of the ſoul in man, and of that intrinſecall form in other creatures which is <hi>Analogicall</hi> to the ſoul in man, (for it is an Infallible rule in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that no free or voluntary Agent doth move or act in any appetible object, but what the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding firſt preſents, and the will receives as good and elegible, nor in any Inimicitious &amp; deteſtable object, but which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding firſt preſents, and the will reſents as noxious and avoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and in naturall Agents it is more manifeſt, that their <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> motions do proceed from the Intrinſecall acts of their form and nature, as in the aſcent of light things, and the deſcent of heavy.) And therefore in regard theſe Intrinſecall acts are the proper and peculiar Right and Prerogative of God (as is already
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114572:30"/>
proved) it followes by the rules of Logick, that God muſt needs have a principal ſhare and intereſt in the guidance and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions, which are onely fruits and effects of the former. But this wil be made more plain in the ſpecies or parts of this <hi>Externall Regiment:</hi> Which (by reaſon of the various manner after which God doth exerciſe his power in ruling and ordering the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the creature, ſometimes doing it in an extraordinary and miraculous manner, ſometimes onely in a common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) is diſtinguiſhed into theſe two ſpecies. 1. Miraculous and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Regiment. 2. Common and Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miraculous Regiment <hi>is the exerciſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Adminiſtration of Power and Authority over the Externall motions and actions of the Creature, after an extraordinary and miraculous manner.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which it is not difficult to determine in whom the propriety of intereſt and Title remaineth; For even the <hi>Magitians</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> themſelves (although they uſed their utmoſt endeavour before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to advance the reputation of their <hi>Magicall</hi> art and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer derived from the <hi>Devill,</hi> and to make that power whereby the <hi>Devill</hi> wrought in them, ſeem as great and miraculous as that power whereby God wrought in <hi>Moſes</hi>) yet did they at length acknowledge <hi>Moſes</hi> his miracles to be wrought <hi>by the finger of God,</hi> and to exceed their own and all other created power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. <hi>Ex.</hi> 8.18. For all theſe ſeeming miracles which are done by <hi>Magitians</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> through the Devils aſſiſtance, are but meer fantaſies and deluſions, and are either nothing at al in reality, or at leaſt-wiſe nothing ſuch as they ſeem to be. For though the Devil be conſcious of the limitation of his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by God, and of his own Inability to do any thing exceeding the limits of Art and Nature, yet hath it alwaies been the Devils greateſt ambition to work an opinion in man of his own Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and in that particular to ſhare with God in his glory: And therefore the Devil is more Gods Ape in this kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and more diligent and ſolicitous to Imitate God in his miraculous works, then in any other. And whereas the object of Gods miraculous power is either ſubſtances, or quantities, or qualities (which three indeed comprehend all things which have abſolute being and exiſtence, for all thoſe relative Entities which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114572:31"/>
are placed in the other ſeven predicaments are but onely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial <hi>ſuperadditaments</hi> grounded upon one of theſe three) in every one of which we find by the Records of Scripture, that God hath exerciſed his power after a miraculous and extraordinary manner. 1. In ſubſtances, and that either by a miraculous creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as in the ſeveral ſorts of noxious creatures which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon a ſuddain for the plaguing of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians. Exod. Ch.</hi> 8.9. and 10. And the <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quailes</hi> which fell amongſt the tents of the <hi>Iſraelites. Exo.</hi> 16. and thoſe Pillars of fire and cloud, which conducted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their way both by day and night. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14) or elſe by a miraculous Annihilation (as in <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſacrifice, and the twelve ſtones upon which he offered it, and the twelve barrels of water which he powred upon it. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.38.) or elſe by a miraculous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, (as in the water of <hi>Egypt</hi> changed into blood. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. and in that water which <hi>Chriſt</hi> changed into wine. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 2. In quantities, and that either by a miraculous Augmentation (as in the multiplication of the loaves and fiſhes. <hi>Mat. Ch.</hi> 14. and 15. &amp; of the oyl and meal of the widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> by <hi>Elijah.</hi> 1 <hi>Ki.</hi> 17. and of the oyl of the Prophets widdow by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to pay her debts. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 4.) or elſe by a miraculous diminution (as in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that over-plus and exuperancie of <hi>Manna</hi> unto the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meaſure of an Omer, which ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of greedineſſe had gathered, farre exceeding that proportion. <hi>Exo.</hi> 16.18.) or elſe by a miraculous diviſion (as in dividing the Red ſea for the paſsage of the <hi>Iſraelites. Exo.</hi> 18. and the waters of <hi>Iordan</hi> for the paſsage of <hi>Elijah</hi> and the return of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.) 3. In qualities by a miraculous alteration (as in turning floods into wilderneſs, and the wilderneſs again into a <hi>ſtanding water: making alſo a fruitfull land barren, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein. Pſa.</hi> 107. <hi>In interrupting the courſe, and</hi> ſtopping the motion of the Sunne and Moone. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Suns uſuall courſe, cauſing the retrogradation of ten degrees. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. In Converting the rudeneſs and ſimplicity of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> into a Superlative eloquence in variety of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and moſt profound knowledge in the myſteries of Salvation, as their own writings teſtify. In reunion of Soul and body, and raiſing the dead to life, as in the widdows ſonne. 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 17. The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114572:31"/>
                  <hi>Shunamites</hi> ſonne, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 4. and in <hi>Lazarus, Iohn,</hi> 11.) Now although the <hi>Devils</hi> power really extend not to the production of the leaſt of theſe miraculous effects: (unleſſe it be by way of ſubordinate and Inſtrumentall Agency, as the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other creatures have done and ſtill may do, when and where it pleaſeth God for the promotion and advancement of his own glory, to make uſe of their miniſtery and ſervice to that purpoſe) yet doth he (by deluſive vertue of his art &amp; dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; thoſe tranſcendant faculties wherewith God hath enriched his Angelicall nature, wherein the Devill is not inferior to the perſevering and Celeſtiall Angels) endeavour to poſſeſſe men with an idolatrous opinion of his ability to effect the greateſt; whether it be in ſubſtances, or in quantities, or in qualities. 1. In ſubſtances, as in thoſe phantaſmes which he preſents before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thoſe which be in Covenant with him, to ſatiſfie their deſires and wiſhes: which he doth either by aſſuming the ſhape of ſuch a Creature (for that power the Devill hath, though the form thereof be never ſo beautifull or Angelicall, as when by the conſpiration of the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> the Devill appeared unto <hi>Saul</hi> in the form of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. but ſuch ſpectra's and apparitions are no reall bodies, but onely appeare ſuch to the ſight, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf proveth by that Argument which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to ſatiſfy the fears &amp; doubts of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> concerning himſelf, when they ſuppoſed him to have been a <hi>ſpirit, Luk.</hi> 24.39. <hi>handle me and ſee (ſaith he) for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee mee have,</hi> or elſe by entring &amp; actuating in the real body of ſome other corporeall Creature; and ſo indeed the Devil may appeare in a true and real body (as he did in the <hi>Serpent</hi> which deceived <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. and thus he entred, and moved, and ſpoke in the dumb Idols which were the Oracles of the heathen: And ſo he ſometimes acts in the very bodies of dead or murdered men and women: Which he doth, not by way of information, but of inlocation onely:) neither the Devill nor any created power is able to make one real body or any part thereof, no not ſo much as <hi>one hair white or black,</hi> for that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf intimateth to be the very prerogative of God alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.36. 2. In quantities (as when the Devill maketh witches beleeve that he reduceth their bodies into the formes of ſuch minute creatures as may paſs

through key holes like Bees or flies, or other ſmal paſſages like Cats or Hares, which is done meerly by poſſeſſing their fantaſies with ſuch conceits; and the Devill himſelf acting for them the ſame things which the witches beleeve that they act themſelves; for as the Devill cannot adde one <hi>cubit unto a mans ſtature,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he diminiſh any thing thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.27.

               <p>THE ſecond ſort of <hi>Externall Regiment</hi> which is the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſpecies to Miraculous Government; whereof we have already ſpoken, is <hi>Ordinary and Common Regiment,</hi> which may be thus deſcribed. ORDINARY REGIMENT <hi>is the Adminiſtration and exerciſe of that Power and Authority which the ſuperiour hath over the Extrinſecall Actions and Motions, of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114572:33"/>
inferiour, after a common vſuall and Ordinary manner.</hi> Now this Ordinary and uſuall ſort of <hi>Externall Regiment</hi> may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two wayes, 1. In its Primitive and Originall capacity. 2. In its Derivative and Executive capacity. 1. I ſay in its Primitive and Originall capacity; and ſo it is the peculiar Right and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God, who is the principall Agent, and by his conſtant and continuall wiſdome and providence doth guide, order and diſpoſe all the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions of the Creature, for his own glory and the good of his children, without which no humane wiſdom or experience, no humane care or circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were able to direct or bring them to thoſe ends.</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in that Pſalm of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 107. attributeth the Regency of all <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions in the creature totally to God, demonſtrating all the affaires both of the Godly and wicked (whether at ſea or land, whether in City or wilderneſſe, whether in or without the body) to be ordered and regulated by God, according to his rules of mercy and juſtice. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us diligently to caſt all our care upon God, for two reaſons, Firſt becauſe God doth provide whatſoever is neceſſary for the ſuſtenance of our lives, whether it be food or raiment, (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by inſtances in his providence and care for creatures of farre leſſe value and eſtimation then men: For he plentifully feeds the very <hi>Sparrows,</hi> and doth ſumptuouſly cloath the very <hi>Lillies</hi>) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe God doth carefully protect us from all injuries, in regard he hath taken the number of the very haires of our heads, not one whereof without his wil &amp; pleaſure can be puld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by our moſt potent &amp; violent enemies. Nay the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf in his diſputation with <hi>Iob,</hi> alledgeth many unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convince his judgement in this point, by Inſtances in his own Regency of the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions of many creatures, who therein are wholly exempted from the Rule and Dominion of man, as we may read at large in the latter part of the book of <hi>Iob</hi> from <hi>Ch.</hi> 38. unto the laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This uſuall and Ordinary kind of <hi>Externall Regiment,</hi> may be conſidered in its Derivative and Executive capacity, and ſo it is Communicated by God unto the creatures, to whom he hath delegated an Inſtrumental power, for the Immediate execution of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114572:34"/>
his will and pleaſure, in the actuall Government and Rule of the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions of the creatures of this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our world, A further Illuſtration whereof is preſented unto us in the explication of the ſeverall parts of this ſecond ſort of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Government,</hi> ariſing from the ſeverall degrees of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſubordination amongſt the creatures, which conſidered together with the <hi>Creator</hi> do conſtitute a compleat <hi>Category</hi> of this Ordinary ſort of <hi>Externall Government,</hi> wherein we have the very form and Method of Gods uſual and ordinary Government of the world and the creatures therein, and in what manner God doth make uſe of the Miniſtery and ſervice of one ſort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the rule and Government of another in relation to their <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions; the ſeries of which <hi>Categorie</hi> comprehends theſe four degrees of ſuperiority and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1.

                  <item>2. The firſt ſubalternate ſpecies, and that is the ſupernaturall and <hi>Spirituall Agents,</hi> which are the <hi>Angels,</hi> who in relation to God are ſubordinate, and have a ſuperiour Guide and Ruler over them: But in relation to all other creatures, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the ſupream Guides and Rulers, and do alwaies give, but never receive any commands from any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
                  <item>3. The ſecond ſubalternate ſpecies, and that is the <hi>Intellectuall Agents, viz:</hi> Men, who in relation both to God and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are ſubjects and inferiours, and are by them ordered aad commanded: but in relation to meer naturall <hi>Agents</hi> are <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> receiving ſufficient Commiſſion from God for that purpoſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and <hi>Cha.</hi> 9.2.</item>
                  <item>4. The laſt &amp; loweſt (and indeed the <hi>Infima</hi>) ſpecies in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament is the naturall <hi>Agent,</hi> which comprehends all other particular kinds of creatures of this inferiour world, which in relation to al the three former ſorts of <hi>Agents,</hi> are altogether ſubordinate and inferiour, neither have they any other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall kind of <hi>Agent</hi> ſubordinate to themſelves, who doth

               <p>From all which it is evident that God (being a God of order and not of confuſion) as he did not in the beginning Conſtitute all his creatures in a parity of <hi>Excellencie</hi> and perfection in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their nature, ſo neither did he conſtitute them in a parity of Power and Dominion in reſpect of their policy: So that whereas the Naturaliſts do generally diſtinguiſh the creatures (by vertue of their ſeverall degrees of <hi>Excellency</hi> and perfection ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their natures) into three generall kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> 2. <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> and 3. <hi>Naturall.</hi> The <hi>Moraliſts</hi> in relation to policy do aſcribe unto each of theſe a ſeverall degree of order and ſubordination; the Supreame and higheſt to <hi>Angels.</hi> 2. to men. 3. to Naturall <hi>Agents:</hi> For <hi>Angels</hi> as they exceed all other creatures in perfection and Excellencie, ſo do they alſo in power and <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> concerning both which, we have a moſt evident Demonſtration in that viſion of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> mentioned in the firſt <hi>Ch.</hi> of his propheſie, where likewiſe (beſides the degrees of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and ſubordination, ariſing from the different perfections of the creatures) we have another direct ground for that <hi>Catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>Predicament</hi> of Government formerly premiſed: for this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion repreſents unto us a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of the two firſt kinds of this <hi>Externall Government.</hi> 1. By God, the <hi>Supream King</hi> and <hi>Ruler,</hi> 2. By <hi>Angels,</hi> his <hi>Immediate Deputies</hi> and <hi>Vice-gerents,</hi> neither of whoſe Perſons nor yet their Immediate wayes and actions being obvious to humane eyes; we could not attain to any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or judgement of their manner of Government, by any ſenſe or experience or any other meanes, but that which God hath revealed Immediately unto us of his ſpeciall <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:</hi> Wherefore for our better inſtruction &amp; Information herein, It pleaſed God by theſe ſenſible and viſible forms, to make known unto his Church and People theſe two firſt kinds of this <hi>Externall Government.</hi> For in this viſion there is preſented unto <hi>Ezekiel</hi> an Appearance of four beaſts, of four wheels, &amp; of a Spirit which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114572:35"/>
had power &amp; preeminence over both the beaſts and the wheels, 1. The principal &amp; chiefeſt of theſe then muſt be the Spirit, which is the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, whoſe power &amp; Maj. is ſet forth in the latter part of that Chap. by the ſenſible ſimilitude of a glorious Throne, and a glorious man ſitting thereupon; For the glory of God doth infinitely more exceed the glory of all the creatures in the world, then the glory of the moſt puiſsant <hi>Prince</hi> ſitting in his Throne of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> doth ſurpaſſe the glory of beaſts or Inanimate bodies.</p>
               <p>And therefore by reaſon of the ſurpaſſing glory and <hi>Majeſty</hi> in God beyond all the creatures in the world, this viſion doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him as the Supream and abſolute <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> both of the beaſts and wheels, of all things both in Heaven and earth, but yet God (as a <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of ſo great a family and Kingdome) doth exerciſe this <hi>Externall Government</hi> either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelf over thoſe creatures which are of greateſt perfection and eminency, or mediately by the Inſtrumental Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the creatures, the <hi>Lord</hi> ordaining thoſe creatures whom he hath made ſuperiour to others in Wiſdome and Excellency, to be his Agents and Officers in the Rule and Government of thoſe whom he hath made inferiour to them in thoſe reſpects: And therefore (becauſe the <hi>Angels</hi> are more <hi>Excellent</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> then all the reſt of their fellow creatures, and in that reſpect neereſt unto God) God doth Rule and Govern them Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himſelfe, and doth alſo conſtitute them his Immediate <hi>Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Deputies</hi> for the Government of both the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall and Naturall Agents: Which Order and Method of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Government</hi> is by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> admirably and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſened unto us in this viſion of <hi>Ezekiel's,</hi> wherein the four beaſts (ſignifying the <hi>Angels</hi>) do expreſſe their diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the orders and commands of the Spirit, whereby they Immediately framed their own Actions and Motions: And wherein likewiſe the four wheels upon the earth (ſignifying all other creatures of this inferiour world) do expreſſe their diligent obſervance of the actions and motions of the four beaſts, as a Rule whereby to frame their own, whether in Station or Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether in Progreſſion or Retrogradation: All which we ſhall more fully explain, in handling the three ſeveral kinds of this <hi>Externall Government:</hi> 1. that which God doth Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114572:35"/>
exerciſe over the <hi>Angels,</hi> 2. that which the <hi>Angels</hi> do Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exerciſe over men, 3. That which men do Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe over the Naturall Agents.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the exerciſe of Gods Immediate Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Rule and Government of the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions of the <hi>Angels,</hi> is not directly our purpoſe in this book, but onely as it were a preface (as I ſaid before) unto that kind of Government which we intend principally to inſiſt upon in the body of this Treatiſe, and in regard alſo we have in all the former Chapters of this book inſiſted principally upon Gods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Government, as well of <hi>Angels</hi> as alſo of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not onely in their <hi>Intrinſecall,</hi> but partly alſo in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall</hi> actions and motions: I will omit all further diſcourſe concerning this firſt kind of Ordinary and <hi>Externall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> leſt I ſhould ſeem to be unneceſſarily and Impertinently voluminous; And ſo proceed in the next Chapter to the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latter part of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> viſion, wherein is fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Nature and quality of this ſecond ſort of <hi>Externall</hi> and Ordinary Government, and of that Power and Authority which the <hi>Angels</hi> do exerciſe over the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions of all <hi>Terreſtriall</hi> and <hi>Sublunarie</hi> creatures; the true and lively Portraiture of which kind of Government, is indeed the very ſcope and intent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in this viſion.</p>

this viſion: Wherein by two ſorts of viſible things, are repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Firſt the <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> creatures Governing, Secondly the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall</hi> creatures Governed. The <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> creatures which are the <hi>Angels of God,</hi> are here repreſented by four Beaſts; in the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of whoſe perſons the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth diligently ſet forth unto us thoſe perfections &amp; excellencies wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched their <hi>Angelicall</hi> Nature, purpoſely to fit and enable them for the execution of that office &amp; ſervice which he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them in the Immediate Rule and Government of this inferiour world: For which purpoſe in the deſcription of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of theſe four Beaſts, there are five things obſervable: 1. The ſubſtance of their proportion. 2. Their faces. 3. Their wings. 4. Their feet. 5. Their hands.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The ſubſtance of their proportion, wherein the Beaſts are ſaid to reſemble a Man, whereby is expreſſed the <hi>Majeſticall</hi> and glorious preſence of the <hi>Celeſtiall Angels;</hi> beings quality requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in the carriage and demeanour of a Governour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their faces which are many and ſeverall, to ſignifie the multiplicity and variety of thoſe gifts and faculties wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath endowed the <hi>Angels;</hi> &amp; that alſo in ſuch an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection as is fit and requiſite for the Immediate offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and miniſters of ſo great and glorious a King, to enable them for the performance of that ſervice and duty which he hath appointed unto them; for which cauſe every one of the four Beaſts are ſaid to have four faces, reſembling thoſe four living creatures which are moſt eminent in thoſe four ſeverall properties and qualities which are required in a compleatly-qualifyed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>(viz. Knowledge, Prudence, Valour,</hi> and <hi>Diligence)</hi> as neceſſary for the judiciall part of his office and calling. <hi>One of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is the face of an Eagle.</hi> Whereby in the Excellency of the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> ſight, is repreſented the perfection and exquiſiteneſſe of the <hi>Angels</hi> knowledge in all worldly affaires, where nothing is done or acted, which can be hid from their eyes, which can be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the <hi>Angels</hi> knowledge; my meaning is onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning outward actions; for I formerly ſhewed, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the ſecret thoughts of the heart, is Gods own prerogative; and doth not fall within the compaſſe of the <hi>Angels</hi> priviledges, nor of their Government: 2. <hi>Face</hi> is the face of a man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114572:36"/>
is ſignifyed their <hi>prudence diſcretion</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> to order and diſpoſe all the Externall actions and motions of the creatures committed unto their tuition and Government for the honour of their Lord and Maſter, and the good of his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third face</hi> is the face of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> whereby is ſignifyed their Courage, Valour and Ability to conquer and ſubdue whatſoever is repugnant to their maſters will. The fourth <hi>face</hi> is the face of an <hi>Ox,</hi> whereby is ſignified their conſtant Induſtrie, Labour and travell in their Maſters ſervice, for the <hi>Angels</hi> are ready and attendant day and night, every hour and minute upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters buſineſſe, which they diligently perform and diſpatch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weariſomneſſe, without grudging, or Complaining.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 4. 5. As for the three laſt parts to be obſerved in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and deſcription of theſe four Beaſts: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Their wings,</hi> 2. <hi>Their feet,</hi> 3. <hi>Their hands.</hi> They ſignify thoſe three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are requiſite in a Governour, as to the executive part of his office, which is after judgement is paſſed, to act and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the decrees thereof. And theſe properties are 1. quickneſſe, 2. Deliberateneſſe, 3. Accurateneſſe. In each of which reſpects the <hi>Angels</hi> are provided to act as occaſion requires: 1. If it be a Decree of ſuddain vengeance to the wicked, or like deliverance to the Godly, they have wings to ſpeed the execution thereof. 2. If it be a Decree of Patience and long ſuffering, till the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the wicked have fulfilled the meaſure of their ſinne: Or the afflictions of the ungodly have exhibited a ſufficient triall of their Faith; they have Calves feet to proceed with ſlower paces. 3. If it be to ſever and ſegregate the Godly from the wicked, in the exhibition of mercies to the one, or judgements to the other: they have mens hands to uſe ſuch accurateneſſe in gathering the <hi>Tares</hi> into bundles to be burnt, that not one of them ſhall eſcape the fire of Hell. And in gathering the <hi>Wheat</hi> into Gods barn, that not one corn ſhall be ſcattered, which ſhall not be carefully laid up, and reſerved unto Eternall happineſs in the Kingdome of Heaven. Nay not one Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> ſhall be loſt or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt millions of <hi>Sodomites,</hi> as appeares by the declaration made by the two <hi>Angels</hi> of their own diſability to do any thing againſt <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> till <hi>Lot</hi> was ſeparated and ſafe in <hi>Zoar. Gen.</hi> 19.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114572:37"/>The laſt particular of this viſion of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> is the four Wheels upon the earth, which repreſent all the Creatures of this inferior world, as well Intellectual as Natural Agents, whoſe <hi>Externall</hi> actions and motions are Immediately Governed and directed by the Miniſtery of <hi>Angels:</hi> In which deſcription the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth ſet forth the grounds of the Inſufficiency of theſe Terreſtriall creatures, to order and direct their own actions and motions, and thereupon with what readineſs and reverence they ſubmit themſelves unto the rule &amp; government of <hi>Angels.</hi> For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the deſcription of theſe four wheels, there are three things obſervable, <hi>viz:</hi> 1. Their figures, 2. Their order, 3. Their Ornaments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their figure, and that is Circular, ſutable unto the things of this world in two reſpects. 1. Of various inconſtancy and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in relation to particulars. 2. Of ſimilar revolution and Renovation, in relation to the Univerſe. Their firſt ſimilitude is in alteration and inconſtancy: For as in a wheel ſometimes one part is up &amp; ſometimes another, and that which was juſt now the higheſt, is turned down into the place of the loweſt, and the loweſt up againe into the place of the higheſt: So it comes to paſs in the affaires of this world, whether they relate to particular perſons or to publick ſtates, as is amply and perſpicuouſly declared in the propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> both in the <hi>Prophets</hi> expoſition of <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad-nezzers Image. Chap.</hi> 2. And then the <hi>Angels</hi> expoſitions of the <hi>Prophets</hi> own viſions, repreſenting under the formes of ſeveral beaſts, all the moſt eminent riſes and fals in the Empires of the <hi>Babylonians, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> both in <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſucceſsors, the <hi>Lagidae</hi> and the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> from <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. to the laſt. A confirmation whereof we may find in every Nationall <hi>Chronicle.</hi> Nay alas, even the preſent experience of our own Nation is unhappily plentifull in miſerable inſtances to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; upon the relation whereof, I need not here inſiſt, they having been too obvious to the eyes of all men in every corner of this kingdome. The ſecond Analogy and reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſublunary things &amp; theſe wheels in relation to their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is their Circular revolutions and Renovations: For of a wheel, the ſame part which is now the higheſt, after ſome Degrees of turn and change, obtaineth the ſame place again, and the loweſt after many riſes fals down by Degrees likewiſe to the ſame place again; ſo experience ſheweth us the like circular returnes and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114572:37"/>
revolutions to obtain a place both in Natural and Politick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: For we ſee that dayes, and nights, and moneths, and yeers, and ſummer, and winter, and ſeed time, and harveſt, do we come and go and return again according to the Ordinance of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22. And the reaſon of this Circular order obſerved in their motions, is the like order obſerved in the motions of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and all the <hi>Celeſtiall Orbs</hi> and fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> which God did ordain to guide and rule theſe times and ſeaſons. Nay the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> (who attribute the Rule and guidance of all humane affaires unto the <hi>Starres</hi>) do affirm every fourth, eighth, twelfth and nineteenth year to renew the like miſfortunes or ſucceſses unto men, by reaſon of the ſimilar conjunctions and aſpects of the <hi>Planets,</hi> which are Incident to theſe Revolutions, as is at large expreſsed in <hi>Whickerus.</hi> But though I acknowledge the <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> bodies to have an influence upon all ſublunary bodies, yet I do not make ſuch <hi>Aſtrologicall</hi> concluſions any part of my faith, for that <hi>Sapiens Dominabitur Aſtris,</hi> was the perſwaſion of a learned heathen, which the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf confirmes out of his own mouth, wiſhing us to obſerve how he himſelf doth manifeſt his own prerogative in all humane affaires, by <hi>fruſtrating the tokens of the Soothſayers, and making di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners mad, Eſay</hi> 44.25. And therefore we ſee that all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers</hi> and <hi>Soothſayers</hi> in <hi>Caldee</hi> could not foretell the <hi>ſeptena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> madneſs of <hi>Nabuchad-nezzar,</hi> inflicted by God for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>ſeptenarian</hi> work of <hi>Solomon</hi> (his holy Temple.) Neither when he was mad could they Divine when he ſhould be reſtored either to his ſenſes or his Kingdome. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. Nay though the fertility of the earth doth manifeſtly depend upon the influence of the Heavens, and the ſterility of the earth proceed of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due obſtruction of the Heavens, as <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Yet could not all the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> foretell the preceding plenty of the firſt ſeven yeares, and the ſucceeding famine of the next ſeven, prefigured in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> dream, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. But though theſe Revolutions in humane affaires, do not ſo neceſsarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>Starres,</hi> yet that ſuch do come to paſs, we have <hi>Solomons</hi> own Teſtimony. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. and that alſo grounded upon his own experience; wherein ours alſo cannot be wanting, if we obſerve but the courſes and changes falling out amongſt our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114572:38"/>
ſelves in the faſhions of habits and other matters, wherein we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from one to another, til that which was the furtheſt out of date, become the moſt in requeſt again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing obſervable in theſe Wheels, is their order which is very confuſed and Intricate; For the Text ſaith, that the appearance of the Wheels and of their work, was as it were a Wheel in the middle of a Wheel, thereby repreſenting the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſedneſs of mans underſtanding and knowledge in the myſteries of Gods providence, being farre unable to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or diſcern all the turnings and windings of the Wheels, that is, all the waves and courſes which the wiſdome of God doth purſue in the Government of the inferiour world: For men, (the wiſeſt of all earthly creatures) do onely diſcern things that are preſent and neer at hand, and thoſe alſo, but onely in a ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and imperfect manner, and accordingly they judge. We ſee <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſold into a ſtrange countrey, and there caſt into a deſolate Dungeon, and like his evill and unnatural Brethren we judge him as ſurely loſt, as if he had been indeed devoured by ſome wilde Beaſt. We ſee juſt <hi>Iob</hi> miſerably afflicted and tormented by the Devil, and left as naked of all worldly helpes and comforts, as he was the firſt minute which God took him out of his Mothers womb: And like his three miſerable comforters, we judge him to be made an exemplary preſident by God, not onely of worldly miſfortune and miſery, but even of Gods Eternal wrath and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yea what man (Ignorant of future Events) would not have judged <hi>Hamans</hi> eſtate happier in the <hi>Kings</hi> palace, then <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai's</hi> who begged at the <hi>Kings</hi> gates: Proud <hi>Herod</hi> ſecurer upon his Throne, then <hi>Peter</hi> a priſoner in Chaines and fetters: And <hi>Pilates</hi> condition better upon his Judgements ſeat, then <hi>Chriſts</hi> when he was nailed to the fatal Croſs? For alas, the judgement and knowledge of man in all worldly matters, reacheth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the very preſent and outward face thereof; As conſtant experience daily Demonſtrates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third and laſt thing obſervable in theſe Wheels is their Ornaments, and thoſe are the numerous <hi>eyes</hi> in the <hi>Rings</hi> of the four Wheels. For the Text ſaith, <hi>Their Rings were full of eyes,</hi> which eyes do not ſignifie any fore-ſight, wiſdome or knowledge to be in the earthly creatures, for the Rule and direction of their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114572:38"/>
own actions but their vigilant obſervance of all the actions and motions of the <hi>Angels,</hi> as a rule whereby to order and frame their own actions and motions of what nature ſoever, whether it concern their ſtation, or progreſſion, or elevation: For ſaith the Text, When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them, when the living creatures were lift up from the earth, the Wheels were lift up, and when thoſe ſtood, theſe ſtood: which paſſages expreſſe the exact and diligent conformity of earthly creatures to the commandments of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over them to guide them in all their wayes, whether good or evil: yea and that in evil of ſinne as well as evil of puniſhment. Firſt for evil of ſinne, there are evil Spirits to ſeduce and miſlead men: An evil Spirit led the men of <hi>Shechem</hi> into Traiterous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt their <hi>King. Jud.</hi> 9. An evil Spirit ſeduced <hi>Ahab:</hi> 1 <hi>Kin,</hi> 22. <hi>Satan</hi> provoked <hi>David</hi> to number the people. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.1. Again in the puniſhments of the wicked, the <hi>Angels</hi> are the executioners of Gods judgements, as upon the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19. upon the Adulterous and Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites, Num.</hi> 22. Upon the blaſphemous <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. Nay <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf giving a caution concerning the offending of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. alledgeth this ground for it, that the <hi>Angels</hi> (whom God appointeth for the tuition and guard of theſe little ones) are continually ſolicitors to God in their behalf, Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vengeance upon ſuch pittyleſſe injuſtice, and ſeverely reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the injuries done to ſuch Innocents, ſo that (as it is expreſſed in the Text) <hi>It were better for a man to have a milſtone hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the ſea,</hi> then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the puniſhments inflicted by the <hi>Angels</hi> upon ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Laſtly the <hi>Angels</hi> are not leſſe ſolicitous for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Godly in all their wayes, though it be in the midſt of the fire, as in the three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. Or in a Denne of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>Lyons,</hi> as in the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. Nay the Prophet making a large declaration of Gods care and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards his children in all ſorts of dangers, as in war, in peſtilence, and all manner of Epidemicall judgements, inflicted by God for the Epidemicall ſinne of a nation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this as a ſure ground of confidence for their ſafety in the midſt of all dangers <hi>(Even when thouſands fall beſide them, and ten

But theſe profound ſecrets &amp; Eminent abilities are Gods own prerogative. And therefore the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (to prevent our ſinfull miſtakes in this inſtrumentall Regency of the creatures, who through our own Ignorance and the <hi>Devils</hi> ſubtile temptations, are apt to look with an idolatrous eye upon the Immediate and Inſtrumentall Agents, (as appeares in the men of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> who could ſcarce be reſtrained from offering ſacrifice to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> Acts. 14.18.)

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The reaſon I conceive is, becauſe all Authors, as wel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine as humane, do both divide and compleat both the Globes of the world by four dimenſions, <hi>viz</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South; as wel the Globe of the Heavens, which are the habitations of <hi>Angels,</hi> as of the Earth, which is the habitation of all Terreſtriall creatures. An inſtance of the latter we have 1. In Gods Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal providence over his children in the whole earth, which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> expreſseth in extending the ſame unto the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.3. And 2. In the <hi>Perſian</hi> conqueſt of the whole earth, repreſented by a <hi>Ram</hi> puſhing and ſubduing Northward, and Southward, and Weſtward, where the Eaſt is to be preſuppoſed, becauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> were <hi>Emperours</hi> of the Eaſt before. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. And an inſtance of the former we have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. Where the Prophet <hi>David</hi> (proving God alone to be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114572:40"/>
the fountaine of all Honour and happineſs, (&amp; no creature in the world) which the vain Idolaters of his time, Notwithſtanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from the Sun which they therefore worſhipped as their God) telleth them, that <hi>Promotion commeth neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor yet from the South,</hi> where the North is to be underſtood for the fourth dimenſion of the Heavens, wherein the Sun moveth, though it be not here expreſsed, becauſe the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when thoſe Idolaters lived, was ſituated Northward from the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and therefore they did never turn their faces toward the North to behold the Sun, but onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other three parts of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee by the Expoſition of this viſion of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> what the nature of this ſecond ſort of <hi>Externall Regiment</hi> is, and in what ſort it pertaineth to the <hi>Angels,</hi> and what the grounds are, why God hath delegated this power unto the <hi>Angels</hi> over all earthly creatures, as wel Intellectual as Natural Agents. It followeth now (by the Rule of our premiſed Method) that we ſhould ſpeak of the third and laſt ſort of <hi>Externall Regiment,</hi> wherein God doth make uſe of the Inſtrumental Regency of the Intellectual Agents, for ordering and directing the <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> actions and motions of the Natural Agents, of which very briefly.</p>

there now be many noyſome and noxious creatures in the world, who have utterly rejected this yoke of obedience and ſubjection unto man, and do expreſſe a certain Antipathy and malignancie in their diſpoſitions towards him: Yet none of thoſe creatures were ſuch in their native and Original conſtitution as they were created by God; which appeared by their readineſs to come before <hi>Adam</hi> and do him homage, and in further token of their ſubjection, to receive names from him: For Impoſition of names was alwaies amongſt the Ancients a Cognizance of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Authority (which was the cauſe why Conquering Kings uſually gave names unto ſuch as they ſubdued; ſo the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> when he had vanquiſhed <hi>Joachaz,</hi> and made his brother <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim</hi> King, he changed his name to <hi>Jehojakim.</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24.

Whereby it is evident that the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty of the ſavage Beaſts towards man, is no Naturall but meerly an adventitious quality, iſsuing from that Divine male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which was the fruits of <hi>Adams diſobedience,</hi> whereby man loſt part of that Prerogative wherewith he was Originally inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God: who puniſhed the Rebellion and Diſloyalty of man to himſelf, by the like Rebellion and Diſloyalty in theſe creatures to man to become Maſters over us, making them whom he had ordained to be ſervants to us, becauſe we diſdaind to be ſervants to him, who by Right was Maſter both over them and us.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, if the Antipathy and Malignancy in thoſe Beaſts towards Man were not natural, then the preſervation of <hi>Daniel</hi> from the hungry <hi>Lyons,</hi> had not been miraculous; for if <hi>Daniel</hi> had been ſhut up for a nights ſpace with ſo many <hi>Oxen, Dogs</hi> or <hi>Horſes,</hi> King <hi>Darius</hi> would not have been ſo raviſh't with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment to have found him alive the next morning.</p>

and Annihileation together with it, and ſo the Antipathy and Malignancy in theſe evill beaſts towards man, cannot be termed Natural: For when all the beaſts came to do Homage unto <hi>Adam,</hi> theſe noxious creatures were as abſolutely void of theſe Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant qualities as <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> might at that time with as much ſafety and Indempnity have accompanied or been ſhut up with <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> as we may now with <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Pigeons.</hi> But in the latter ſenſe, thoſe adventitious qualities which proceed onely from ſome <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> cauſe, may be termed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; by reaſon of that ſimilitude which they have with Naturall qualities, in reſpect of cuſtome and continuance, and Inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from their ſubjects: In which ſenſe ſinne is ſaid by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be Naturall unto man, which had its birth the ſame day with the other, theſe Malignant qualities in the creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely the effects of that Divine Malediction which <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne had contracted upon himſelf, his poſterity, and all thoſe creatures which God had made for his uſe and ſervice: By reaſon whereof, the influence of this Divine Malediction is more or leſs effectuall in the creatures, as man is more or leſs defective in his native and Originall Innocency: As <hi>Moſes</hi> doth at large declare, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.

                  </gap> Order is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and preſerver of all things. And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> (out of his care and ſolicitude for the preſervation of particulars which are the very foundation of the Univerſe) did not terminate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Order and Government in the ſpecies of any of the three ſeveral ſorts of creatures, but did alſo Originally conſtitute the particulars of each in different degrees of ſuperiority and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, purpoſely as a ground of that Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ordained to be a meanes of their ſafety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the holy <hi>Angels</hi> we find <hi>Archangels,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. And amongſt the Devils <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.34. Yea the title which is given in Scripture to the ſociety of <hi>Angels,</hi> is a manifeſt Argument of different degrees of Superiority and ſubordination amongſt them, where they are called the Hoſts of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the Armies of the living God: For every Soldier knowes that Order and Government is even eſſentiall to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where ſome muſt neceſſarily command, and others as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily obey. And the obedience of <hi>Angels</hi> (I mean not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall obedience of the whole ſpecies unto God their <hi>Lord</hi> and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114572:43"/>
                  <hi>Maker,</hi> but alſo their particular and mutual obedience to one another) is ſtrongly Intimated by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the third petition of that Prayer, (the practiſe and uſe whereof he enjoyned to all Chriſtians, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.11.) wherein we deſire that our obſervance of Gods will here in earth, may be ſuch as that which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven. Now our obſervance of Gods wil is not terminated in the obedience of the ſpecies unto God, but comprehends alſo the mutual reſpects and duties between Inferiours and ſuperiours, whether it be in Political or paternall Government; For which we have an expreſs in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>And theſe degrees of order and ſubordination are yet more manifeſt in the naturall Agents, which in all their actions are by that Divine Law of nature ſubſervient to each other, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to the earth, both the earth and Heavens to the plants, and all theſe three to ſenſible and Animate creatures, (onely where Divine Malediction, the fruits of mans wickedneſs, to which all theſe creatures are ſubordinate, doth occaſionally ſubvert their Natural courſes, for a puniſhment of mans unnaturall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, turning the Heavens into braſs, and the earth into iron; <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.)</p>
               <p>Neither hath Divine providence left the Inanimate and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures deſtitute of degrees of ſuperiority and ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be a warrantable ground for Order and Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: The <hi>Lyon</hi> is inveſted with a certaine naturall Power and Authority over the Beaſts of the field, who naturally expreſs a certain Dread and Reverence to that courage, Might and cunning wherewith nature hath endowed him. And the <hi>Eagle</hi> is inveſted with the like prerogative over the <hi>fowls</hi> of the Aire, and the <hi>Leviathan</hi> or <hi>Whale</hi> over the fiſhes of the ſea.

               <p>But this Wiſdome and Providence of God in the conſtitution of degrees of ſuperiority and ſubordination amongſt the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Immediate ſpecies of the Univerſe, is moſt manifeſt in the ſpecies of the Intellectuall creatures, which is the ground of

Politick Government, concerning which he that had an ambition to be voluminous, might here meet with ſufficient and even wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opportunity for the accompliſhment of his deſires (this point being the ſubject of all Hiſtories and Chronicles) both ſacred and prophane.) which have been penned ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Prothiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> of the world.

From which very fountain they likewiſe derive as ſtrong an aſsurance, that one and the ſame Government hath not been alwaies obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all nations and ſocieties. For though we find no other kind of Government but <hi>Monarchie,</hi> ſo much as once mentioned either in the Old or new Teſtament, (both which are ſtored with variety of paſsages concerning <hi>Monarchie</hi> and Kings) And ſurely if any <hi>Polarchie,</hi> even the moſt laudable ſort that ever was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either by the <hi>Athenians, Lacedemonians, Syracuſans,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had been capable of any of thoſe Divine ſanctions whereof <hi>Monarchy</hi> doth participate, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> would never have paſt over all them in ſuch a profound and Univerſall ſilence, and have mentioned onely <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the onely received Policy, both amongſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> and all other Nations, who upon any occaſion are honoured with a place in thoſe ſacred Records) but though no <hi>Polarchie</hi> be honoured with any Divine ſanction, either native or Redemptive, (being in it ſelf a meer curſe in Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon a Nation by Divine Malediction for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; as Warre, Famine, or Peſtilence is, (as I ſhall ſhew more at large in the Subſequent Book;) Yet in Regard many ſorts of <hi>Polarchie</hi> have been honoured with the humane ſanction of practiſe, Preſcription, and Cuſtome, (both before the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by thoſe famous and Renowned Common-wealths prem-entioned, and alſo of late yeares by ſome Chriſtian Common-wealths.) Although there be no more Divinity in any ſort <hi>Polarchie,</hi> or any more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds in Scripture, Nature, or Reaſon, for any man to attempt or endeavour the Erection or inſtitution of any <hi>Polarchicall</hi> Government, then there is for men to contend

               <p>
                  <hi>Monarchie is a politick Government Inſtituted by God for the preſervation of humane ſociety by the Adminiſtration and Exerciſe of the Supream Power and Authority of one perſon over all others in the ſame ſociety.</hi> The former part of which deſcription expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the two External cauſes of <hi>Monarchie;</hi> the latter the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; but yet the Externall cauſes thereof are not herein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that juſt extent and Latitude as to be an entire and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate ground of all the parts of our enſuing diſcourſe in this Book, concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchie;</hi> For <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> doth not onely derive its inſtitution from God the Efficient cauſe thereof, but alſo many other Divine ſanctions: Nor is the preſervation of humane ſociety the adequate end for which God did inſtitute this Government. And therefore (though this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription reacheth the moſt, and indeed more Divine and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114572:45"/>
expreſſions of <hi>Monarchie</hi> then are Recorded by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that I have read upon this ſubject, yet) leaſt I ſhould incurre the guilt of that abſurdity in my preſent diſcourſe, as to extend my ſuperſtructures further then my foundation: I ſhal preſent the Reader with another deſcription, which ſhall reach all that my pen doth ayme at in this preſent diſcovery of the nature and <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> which is this.</p>
               <p>MONARCHIE <hi>is a Politick Government Inſtituted and approved by God, conſiſting in the prudentiall adminiſtration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſupream Power and Authority of one Perſon over all others within the ſame ſociety, for the preſervation of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Order to Gods glory, the Kings honour, and the peoples welfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which deſcription I conceive to be a full expreſſion of all the parts and cauſes of <hi>Monarchie;</hi> the explication whereof, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be the entire buſineſſe of my enſuing diſcourſe, wherein I ſhall obſerve the ſame Method expreſſed in this preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shewing this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> to derive its Originall from God the Efficient cauſe thereof, and that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath alſo honoured the ſame with many recommendatory ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereby to evidence the <hi>Divine Right</hi> thereof, and the true and proper diſtinction of this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> from the curſe of <hi>Polarchie;</hi> all which particulars I have deſigned for the five firſt Chapters of this Book, which ſhall declare the nature and <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchie in its Morall capacity,</hi> as it is grounded upon the habit of Prudence, (which though it be not directly a Moral habit, yet is the fountain of all Moral acts) wherein I hope the Reader ſhall receive ſatiſfaction concerning the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Monarchie</hi> in Relation to the efficient and formal cauſes thereof, which are the firſt two particulars expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the definition of <hi>Monarchie</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place I ſhal ſpeak of this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie in its natural capacity,</hi> as it relateth to that ſupremacie which doth preheminence the <hi>Monarch</hi> above all others within the ſame ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which I terme natural (not ſo much becauſe it is the material cauſe and ground of this Natural bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> (every <hi>Monarch</hi> deriving his title to the Crown from this ſupremacy.) but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114572:46"/>
rather becauſe Supremacy it ſelf doth ordinarily proceed from a meer Natural cauſe, <hi>viz:</hi> Birth-right and hereditary ſucceſſion, and not from the peoples election or any other meanes (<hi>i. e.</hi> juſtly and Legally, for conqueſt is unlawful, unleſſe where it is Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by Gods ſpecial warrants, as I ſhall demonſtrate in the eighth Chapter of this Book.) And this I purpoſe to be the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of the three following Chapters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third and laſt place I ſhal ſpeak of <hi>Monarchie in its Theologicall capacity,</hi> as it relateth to thoſe ends which qualifie al <hi>Monarchical</hi> actions, concerning which I ſhal declare, firſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what the <hi>Monarchicall</hi> honour due to God &amp; the King is, &amp; wherein both that honour and <hi>ſalus populi</hi> doth conſiſt; Secondly their due order, and that the Kings honour is to have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above <hi>ſalus populi</hi> in all the <hi>Monarchicall</hi> actions both of King and ſubjects; in the former of which I ſhall Intimate the duty of Kings in the due limitation of their Power in order to all <hi>Extra Regalia</hi> and Metapolitical matters, and in the latter, the duty of ſubjects in the due extenſion of their obedience in order to all matters within the ſphere of Political cognizance: The explication of which particulars ſhal be compleated in the four laſt Chapters of this Book.</p>
               <p>The firſt point which my Method invites me to inſiſt upon in this Chapter, hath an influence upon all our enſuing diſcourſe, and that is the <hi>Jus Divinum Naturale,</hi> which I mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to this Treatiſe, but referred the more punctual expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof unto this place, purpoſely thereby to uſher the Readers apprehenſion into the more facile and perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that <hi>Divine Right</hi> which is incident to <hi>Monarchie</hi> in all the prementioned Reſpects.</p>
               <p>I ſhal not need to make a repetition here of the ſeveral diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; ſubdiviſions of <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> ſpecified in the Introduction, for if the Reader pleaſe to reperuſe the ſame, there he may find to what ſpecies of <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> this <hi>Naturall Divine Right</hi> which doth claime a place in <hi>Monarchie</hi> properly appertaineth: Which there he ſhall find to be a ſpecies of <hi>Jus Divinum gratioſum,</hi> and thus deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naturall Divine Right,</hi> is that which is grounded upon the will of God revealed in the Scriptures, concerning thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114572:46"/>
truths, whereof Heathens and Chriſtians are equally capable by nature, onely the ſame are made more clearly known and Manifeſt unto <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by Revelations of Scripture,) in thoſe particulars which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath judged requiſite to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for the benefit of the Church) then they can now in this Elapſed and Apoſtate condition be poſſibly known unto man by any natural meanes and helpes. And this <hi>Jus Divinum Naturale</hi> is two-fold, viz. <hi>Implicitum &amp; Explicitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Implicite Divine Right</hi> is that which is grounded upon the will of God revealed in the Scriptures, concerning natural bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings conferred upon us by God, as pledges and expreſſes of his love to us, which bleſſings are notified unto us in Scripture by clear and manifeſt intimation of the acceptability thereof unto God, and Recommendations of the vtility thereof unto man: Which ſanction doth not make a thing abſolutely and Eſſentially <hi>Divine</hi> and neceſſary, excluding all humane option and prudence, and not admitting of any caſe, wherein the Conſcience may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the contrary, without manifeſt guilt of ſin.</p>
               <p>But onely it makes it naturally and Religiouſly eligible, and deſirable of a meanes and help to the performance of thoſe duties which are abſolutely and Eſsentially <hi>Divine</hi> and neceſsary, and thoſe bleſſings which are capable of this recommendatorie ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are the ſame whereof <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency did participate, as natural helpes and meanes for the due performance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto God, (The curſes or oppoſite privations of which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings being the fruits and effects of that <hi>Divine</hi> Malediction which <hi>Adams</hi> prevarication and Apoſtaſie contracted upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Poſterity.) Now though every man be not obliged in conſcience to have and enjoy theſe bleſſings (in regard they are no proper and Immediate part of our duty unto God) nor yet to eſchew the oppoſite curſes (in regard they are not properly ſinnes againſt God) yet is every man obliged in conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and pray for theſe gifts and bleſſings, and to attempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the attainment of the ſame, by all ſuch lawful and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, wayes &amp; meanes, as do not tranſgreſs any of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts &amp; Commandment (which do impoſe a ſanction of a higher nature upon all ſuch matters as are capable thereof) ſo that thoſe gifts and bleſſings are the proper and Immediate object of our
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114572:47"/>
natural deſire, and the Remote and Mediate object of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hope. And therefore are included in a part of that <hi>Divine Oriſon</hi> compoſed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, for the Generall uſe of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſummarily comprehending the whole matter of all devotions: In the fourth petition whereof, we pray for theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts and bleſſings in that expreſsion of <hi>daily bread.</hi> And in like manner alſo every man is obliged in conſcience to deprecate the curſes which are the oppoſite privations of theſe bleſſings, and to endeavour the avoidance thereof by all ſuch lawfull and warrantable wayes and meanes as do not tranſgreſs any of Gods precepts and Commandments, becauſe in their own nature they are <hi>mala poenae,</hi> that is curſes and puniſhments for ſinne, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the exact performance of thoſe duties which are abſolutely and Eſsentially <hi>Divine:</hi> And therefore the laſt peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prementioned <hi>Oriſon</hi> deprecates theſe curſes in this expreſſion; <hi>Deliver us from evill.</hi> Now theſe natural bleſſings which participate of this Implicite <hi>Divine Right</hi> are of two ſorts, viz. <hi>Internall and Externall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Internall</hi> bleſſings, are thoſe which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> termes <hi>bona animi:</hi> And theſe again are of two ſorts. 1. Moral habits which are ſeated in the will. 2. Intellectuall which are feated in the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Intellectual habits are of two ſorts. 1. Speculative, which are three, viz. <hi>Sapientia, Intelligentia, &amp; Scientia.</hi> 2. Practicall, which are two, viz. <hi>Ars &amp; prudentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which habit of Prudence according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is <hi>Recta ratio in agendis,</hi> directing the diſpoſition, and guidance of humane affaires. And this habit of Prudence is three-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Prudentia Ethica,</hi> which directeth the Moral actions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of particular Perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prudentia Oeconomica,</hi> which directeth the actions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a particular family conſiſting of diverſe Perſons,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Prudentia Politica,</hi> which directeth the actions and matters of a publike ſociety conſiſting of diverſe families, which kind of Prudence is termed in <hi>Greek</hi>

                     </gap> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>Politick Government</hi> is the very <hi>eſſe</hi> and being of a multitude, without which it cannot ſubſiſt: And is the very <hi>form and Eſſence of Monarchie,</hi> which ordereth and directeth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114572:47"/>
and matters of a publick ſociety by the Prudence of one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream perſon: Who for this cauſe is termed in <hi>Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, that is, the very foundation of the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubduction of the King produceth neceſsarily the ruine and deſtruction of the people.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Jus Divinum Implicitum,</hi> which relateth to theſe internall bleſſings, or <hi>bona animi,</hi> and particularly to this habit of <hi>Prudence</hi> (the fountain of all Morall acts) is that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly claimes a place in <hi>Monarchie</hi> in its <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Capacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Externall bleſſings,</hi> are thoſe which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> termes <hi>bona cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris &amp; fortunae,</hi> the bleſſings of the body are temporal life, health and beauty, the bleſſings of Fortune, Riches and Honour: Whereof one particular is a Royal deſcent, and another part of that honour is Primogeniture, which doth entitle a man to that ſupremacie which is the material cauſe and ground of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Jus Divinum Implicitum,</hi> which relateth to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> bleſſings and particularly to the bleſſing of Primogeniture in a Royall Progenie is that which doth properly claime a place in <hi>Monarchie,</hi> in its <hi>Naturall capacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Explicite Divine Right,</hi> is that which is grounded upon the will of God revealed in the Scriptures concerning thoſe duties which we are to performe to God as returnes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expreſes of his love to us; the Revelation of which duties is contained in expreſs precepts and Commandments. Which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth make a truth abſolutely and Eſsentially <hi>Divine,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all humane option and prudence, and admitting of no caſe wherein Conſcience may diſpence with the performance thereof, without the guilt of Eternal death and Damnation: the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from ſuch a precept, being <hi>malum culpae,</hi> that is, an evill of ſinne; And therefore this ſanction impoſeth an obligation upon every mans conſcience for the performance of ſuch duties as are thus preciſely commanded in what eſtate or condition ſoever he be, whether Rich or poor, ſick or healthfull, bond or free, in time of warre, or in time of peace. And theſe truths which are capable of this preceptive ſanction, are ſuch whoſe entire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both Immediate and ultimate, conſiſts in action, and are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114572:48"/>
the returnes of Gods love to us, and the very expreſses of our love to him, Of which truths <hi>Chriſt</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>If you know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> For knowledge of theſe truths without performance doth but aggravate our guilt, it being onely our performance of them which can make us happy. And theſe are the dutyes of every mans calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is obliged in conſcience ſo to demean himſelf, that every action which relateth thereunto, may be a Teſtimony of his love to God and his neighbour, by ſquaring it according to that Rule which God hath preſcribed for the Regulation thereof.</p>
               <p>But for the further Illuſtration of this <hi>Jus Divinum explicitum,</hi> you muſt obſerve that there are two ſorts of expreſs precepts and Commandments recorded in Scripture, which do impoſe two ſorts of Explicite and Eſsential Divine ſanctions upon theſe practical truths. 1. Are abſolute and Generall precepts of the Moral Law, which concern the duty of man towards God and his neighbour, which is ſtill the ſame in Eſsence both under the Law and Goſpel, and do Generally oblige all men in all places &amp; at al times, &amp; this kind of precepts it is which adds an abſolute &amp; general ſanction unto thoſe duties which are the end of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</hi> 2. are particular &amp; Circumſtantial precepts, which are not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally obligatory, but do concern either ſome men at al times, as the judicial &amp; Ceremoniall Lawes did the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, &amp; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh,</hi> Profelites, or ſome men onely, and at ſome times onely, as all perſonal Commands given upon particular occaſions; As that to <hi>Saul</hi> for deſtruction of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> with all their ſubſtance. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. And that to <hi>Jonas,</hi> for Proclaiming the deſtruction of <hi>Nineveh. Jonah Cha.</hi> 1. And that to the Prophet which God ſent to <hi>Bethel,</hi> for abſtinence both from meat and drink in that place. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13. Now though theſe precepts be temporally or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally obligatory, and therefore the contempt or neglect thereof, a ſinne which ſtrikes at the very face of God in his prerogative Royal, yet (in regard the performance of them is not a natural, but onely a preternatural duty) they are not equally obligatory to the Conſcience as the precepts of the Moral Law are, nor doth the tranſgreſſion of ſuch Commands render a man equally guilty or liable to thoſe puniſhments of Eternal death and Damnation, which the tranſgreſſion of Moral precepts doth, and therefore

the ſevereſt puniſhments which any Scripture doth annex to ſuch offences, is, that the tranſgreſſour ſhall be cut off from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: As it fel out in that diſobedient Prophet ſlain by a <hi>Lion,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13. But I have no warrant of Scripture to judge him damn'd for that offence; A confirmation whereof, we have from Gods expreſſe declaration of his different regard to the dutyes of the Moral and of the Ceremonial Law, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Querae</hi> Seeing the precepts of the Morall law are more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely obligatory then any other, and the tranſgreſſions of thoſe precepts more ſeverely puniſhable then any other; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought Gods particular and Extraordinary Commands to be obeyed, when they enjoyn an Act contrary to the precepts of the Moral Law, as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering of <hi>Iſaac</hi> for a ſacrifice to God?</p>

               <p>AMongſt all the Natural and common gifts and bleſſings of the Spirit, I do not find any one honoured with greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Implicite ſanctions then this of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> which I ſhall demonſtrate (in this Chapter) to participate of as many, as any ſuch bleſſing is capable of, (the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> thereby manifeſting the excellency and preheminence of this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> above all other natural bleſſings whatſoever.) And thoſe ſanctions are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114572:49"/>
ſix, viz. 1. <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> 2. <hi>Divine preſcription,</hi> 3. <hi>Divine Stipulation,</hi> 4. <hi>Divine Aſſimilation,</hi> 5. <hi>Divine Accommodation,</hi> 6. <hi>Divine Regulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſanction Incident to <hi>Monarchie</hi> is <hi>Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> God himſelf being the Original Author of this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> in the very firſt beginning of the world, Inveſting <hi>Adam</hi> with a <hi>Monarchicall</hi> Supremacy, not onely <hi>Oeconomicall</hi> over that one created family in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> but <hi>Political</hi> over a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety conſiſting of many families which were to deſcend of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> For the ſame Law which Commanded obedience of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Parents, ſervants to Maſters and ſubjects to Kings in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> did oblige all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity for the ſpace of 930. years, to perform this duty of obedience to <hi>Adam,</hi> within which ſpace <hi>Adam</hi> became a Father and Governour not onely <hi>Oeconomicall</hi> of one family, but <hi>Political</hi> of many families, (which as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, is the very ground of <hi>Political</hi> Government, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Monarchie.</hi> Now although this Government be ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moſt commonly paternal, becauſe all <hi>Adams</hi> ſubjects could derive their Pedegree from the blood Royal: Yet is it the very ſame in ſubſtance with that which we terme Regal, (<hi>Monarchie</hi> or Regal Government, being deſcribed by moſt Authors to be a <hi>Political</hi> Government over a ſociety wherein one perſon is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and chief.) And the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to demonſtrate unto us that the name did not create any real difference between this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Government, (which continued til the confuſion of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi>) and Regal Government (which ſtyle the Scripture uſeth for the policies obſerved by ſocietyes, after the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſeventy families of <hi>Noah's</hi> poſterity, being divided by ſo many ſeveral Languages) did afterwards in the penning of the Decalogue upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> uſe onely the word <hi>Father,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all ſorts of Governours, as wel Kings and <hi>Monarchs</hi> as others.</p>
               <p>But to unſcruple all vocabular doubts and difficulties, let us but look into the fourteenth <hi>Ch.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> and there we ſhall find a King of Gods own making, and his Regal Power of Gods own Inſtitution. For <hi>Sem, alias Melchiſedech</hi> was by Gods ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in his Regal and <hi>Sacerdotall</hi> office: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. And therefore is ſtyled by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>King of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114572:50"/>
Righteouſneſſe, and King of Salem,</hi> which is <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where this <hi>Melchizedech</hi> reigned til <hi>Jacobs</hi> time, who at his death (though then a bond-man in <hi>Egypt</hi>) did in his laſt Wil and Teſtament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Ordinance of God concerning the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Monarchie</hi> amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> his own poſterity, and that <hi>Judah ſhould ſway the ſcepter of the Kingdome,</hi> and Reign in that very City, whereof <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was King, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. Of which <hi>Royal tribe,</hi> that great King (the true <hi>Lyon of Judah</hi>) and the true <hi>Shiloh,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſhould deſcend, who by Gods own Ordinance likewiſe was to be born truly and Legally King of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> As the <hi>Angels</hi> declared to the <hi>Wiſe-men,</hi> who by the <hi>Angels</hi> direction enquired at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> for him that was <hi>born King of the Jewes. Mat.</hi> 2.2. Which is alſo Manifeſted by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the derivation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Pedegree from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David. Mat.</hi> 1. and even from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. And this alſo was acknowledged by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf unto <hi>Pilate. John</hi> 18.37.</p>
               <p>Again we ſhall find that ſeveral perſons received their Regall Inveſtiture from Gods Immediate and particular conſignation, who had no other title to that <hi>Monarchical</hi> honour and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie: As <hi>Saul, David, and Solomon</hi> Kings of <hi>Iſrael; Jeroboam, and Jehu,</hi> Kings over the ten Tribes: And amongſt the heathens alſo, <hi>Hazael</hi> was made King of <hi>Syria</hi> by Gods particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; And <hi>Cyrus</hi> was both named and ordained by God to be the <hi>Monarch</hi> and King (which ſhould erect that <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> which Hiſtorians make the ſecond of the four <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the world) above ſeventie years before he was born. <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> God was angry with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for asking a King. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. And did further declare his diſlike thereof by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Thunder and Rain. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. Whereupon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did acknowledg their ſinne in asking a King, and deſired <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> to pray for them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Two things are obſervable in that deſire, 1. The object of the peoples deſire, which was <hi>Monarchie,</hi> or a Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And in relation to this, the deſire was good, being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance of God himſelf. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. And therefore was alſo ſanctified unto the people with the promiſe of a bleſſing, 1
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114572:50"/>
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. and was afterwards alſo confirmed unto them by God himſelf in his own particular Election of another King (even King <hi>David a man after Gods own heart</hi>) to ſucceed <hi>Saul,</hi> and alſo in his ſonne <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſucceed him, both which two were Types of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Prophets of God. 2. The end of the peoples deſire, and that was Idolatrous and ſinful, the people therein looking upon a King as the onely meanes whereby they might attain deliverance from the feares and preſſures under which they groaned at that time, through the Tyranny of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who had ſubdued them; which was the very end why they deſired a King, looking for deliverance from him, and not from God: As God declared unto <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.7. <hi>They have not rejected thee</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) but they have rejected me;</hi> Imputing more to the power of a King for their deliverance, then unto my Power. And therefore to puniſh this Idolatrous truſt of this people, he gave them then a King of that Tribe which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> propheſie did make Tyrannical, viz: of the <hi>Ravening Wolfe of Benjamin. Gen.</hi> 49.27. To whom alone that propheſie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel's</hi> relateth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. concerning the Tyranny of the King that ſhould Reign over the people who deſired a King for this Idolatrous and ſinful end. For neither <hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> were ſuch Tyrants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſanction whereof <hi>Monarchie</hi> doth participate is <hi>Divine preſcription,</hi> God himſelf continuing that Government to his Church and people, from the very beginning of the world, til their ſinnes made them uncapable of any Policy, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to perpetual captivity.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Monarchie</hi> began in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo continued in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſucceſſively til the flood, when <hi>Noa'hs Monarchie</hi> was reduced by the deluge to an <hi>Oeconomie.</hi> And after the earth was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repleniſhed by his three ſons, the Church, (by <hi>Noahs</hi> bleſſing) was limited to <hi>Sem</hi> &amp; his poſterity, which <hi>Sem</hi> was king of <hi>Salem</hi> alias <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he reigned til <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was the twelfth from <hi>Sem,</hi> was fifty yeares of age. <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his poſterity the twelve <hi>Patriarks</hi> and their wives and children, went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they lived in bondage and ſlavery, til God raiſed up <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he made their <hi>Monarch, Judge, and Ruler,</hi> by whoſe hand he delivered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:114572:51"/>And this <hi>Moſes</hi> did Govern them for the ſpace of fourty yeares in the wilderneſſe; upon the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſucceed him in that <hi>Monarchical</hi> Regency, <hi>Num.</hi> 27.18. By whoſe hand the <hi>Lord</hi> ſetled the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> within the ſpace of ſeventeen yeers after the death of <hi>Moſes:</hi> From <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Governed onely by occaſional Judges and <hi>Monarchs,</hi> which God raiſed up for ſome ſpecial and particular deliverance. In <hi>Saul</hi> God reſtored that formal <hi>Monarchie</hi> or Regal Government which the Church enjoyed in the dayes of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf tranſferred from <hi>Saul</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> according to <hi>Jacobs</hi> propheſie: Where the ſupremacy of Regal Power continued whilſt God continued his favour unto that people: til their ſinne and Ingratitude made them unworthy and incapable of the great bleſſings and favour of <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, and brought upon them that heavy curſe of <hi>Anarchy</hi> and want of a policy amongſt themſelves, and made them ſlaves and captives under <hi>Monarchs</hi> and Kings of other Nations, according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his propheſie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.28. which <hi>Anarchie</hi> was that very mark and Stigma of Gods wrath and vengeance, whereby all Nations (whither they ſhould be led captives) ſhould know them to be a people abhorred and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth in the latter part of that Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſanction Incident to <hi>Monarchie</hi> is <hi>Divine Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> God himſelf honouring this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> with many gratious pactions and promiſes to thoſe who were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof, as to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. yea even to wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and Idolatrous <hi>Ieroboam</hi> 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 11. conditionally they did make a right uſe of this high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable calling, whereunto they were advanced by God. Which ſanction is an infallible token of Gods approbation of that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> as a natural gift and bleſſing requiſite to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfection, for the <hi>Lord</hi> did never thus directly declare his approbation of any curſe or privation of theſe bleſſings, which was an effect of ſinne; nor of any calling which was directly grounded thereupon, ſuch as that <hi>Monkiſh mendicancie,</hi> which is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For that Command of <hi>Chriſts</hi> to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114572:51"/>
the young man in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was principally probatory, and all <hi>Chriſts</hi> promiſes made either to him or his Diſciples, for Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of their Piety who forſake all for his ſake, relate prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily &amp; properly to the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; to ſuch diſvaluations and diſertions of worldly and Natural gifts and bleſſings, onely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally and in a ſecondary ſenſe, when they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is to be preferred above all other things whatſoever, though they be as dear and precious to us as <hi>Brother or Siſter, or Father or Mother, or even as our own eyes, or our own lives, Mat.</hi> 16.25. But I ſay ſuch curſes and privations of worldly and Natural gifts and bleſſings were never directly and poſitively honoured with the ſanction of a Remunerative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (as <hi>Monarchie</hi> is in the prementioned Text.) being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves properly a part of <hi>Jus Divinum Vindicativum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth ſanction whereof <hi>Monarchie</hi> doth participate, is <hi>divine Aſſimilation,</hi> Monarchie being a reſemblance of the moſt exact Modell, in <hi>Divinity, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Divinity,</hi> or divine policy, and that both creative and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptive, For firſt when God had framed the world, and ſtored it with ſuch a numerous variety of creatures; God claimed the Prerogative of an Univerſal <hi>Monarch</hi> to himſelf alone; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning both Devils and men to everlaſting torments, for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining but a thought of competition with him in this his <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi> honour. 2. When he Redeemed the world, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Government thereof unto his Sonne, yet was the ſame policy ſtil retained, nor did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever admit of any competitor in his Government. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Monarchie</hi> is a reſemblance of the moſt exact Model <hi>in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and that is man, both in his numericall and ſpecifical capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: Firſt in his numerical capacity, (whereby I underſtand the frame of his own body, termed by Philoſophers <hi>Microcoſmus</hi>) by reaſon of the Analogie the body of man hath with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe in relation to order and Government: For though it be compoſed of many parts of different qualities, and which are ſubſervient to the body in different offices, yet it hath but one head for the guidance and direction of all, unleſſe it be in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which are therefore juſtly termed Errours in Nature, as all <hi>Polarchies</hi> are in Policy. Secondly in his ſpecifical capacity,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114572:52"/>
(whereby I underſtand the multiplication of his ſeed and iſſue, which is the continuation of his ſpecies) which though never ſo numerous yet is but one man the Father of al; even as a <hi>Monarch</hi> is one Ruler over many ſubjects. I confeſſe indeed the unlawful, various, and inſatiate deſires of the Mother, may be a meanes why the children of one family may have many Fathers: And indeed the very like deſires in a countrey (which is our politick Mother) I conceive to have been the very firſt ground for the erection of <hi>Polarchies,</hi> by the conſtitution of many Supream heads and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in one Common-wealth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Monarchie</hi> is a reſemblance of the moſt exact Model in <hi>Art,</hi> and of that Policy which is the Maſter-piece of the moſt Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Imitator, and the moſt curious Artiſt in the world <hi>viz.</hi> the Devil. And I confeſſe it is an Argument which hath no weak or mean influence upon my underſtanding and judgement to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Divine</hi> Excellency of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> that Satan doth make it the object of his option, as the moſt glorious diſguiſe for that grand Impoſtor the man of ſinne, wherein to act his Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and blaſphemous tragedies in the latter dayes: which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. For though Satan be the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligner of all <hi>Divine</hi> truths, yet we are ſure he is the moſt exquiſite knower, and the moſt Artificial Imitator thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to create the greater eſteem and Reverence in mens hearts, of the Power and Majeſty of his Eldeſt and beſt beloved Sonne, he wil be ſure to uſurp that form of Government which is moſt glorious, <hi>Divine,</hi> and plauſible in the eyes of men, to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions more Potent and Effectuall.</p>
               <p>Now the Text plainly declares that <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Government ſhall be <hi>Monarchical,</hi> and that he wil admit of no competitor, but <hi>will exalt himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that he as God, ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God:</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhal Reign as an Univerſal and abſolute <hi>Monarch</hi> here on earth.</p>
               <p>And the ſame happineſſe which the erronious expectations of the <hi>Jewes</hi> are fixed upon, and hope to receive by the Government of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> at his comming, (who as they conceive ſhall be abſolute King and <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole world, and exerciſe an abſolute Power and Authority over all Kings and Nations both
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114572:52"/>

               <p n="5">5. The fift ſanction whereof <hi>Monarchie</hi> doth participate, is <hi>Divine Accomodation;</hi> God himſelf ſitting and apportioning this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> for the moſt commodious Inſtrument and meanes to advance virtue &amp; Piety, and more eſpecially unitie and concord (the Baſis and foundation <hi>Salutis Populi</hi>) and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vice and iniquity, more particularly civil diſcords and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions (the very <hi>Morbi laethales populi, &amp; Rei publicae</hi>) whereof the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf exhibited a <hi>manifeſto</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after they were ſetled by <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the ful poſſeſſion of the land of Promiſe, when the <hi>Lord</hi> (to the intent the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might take a more full and perfect Eſtimate of this bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi>) did (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his cuſtomary Method in conferring bleſſings upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by making firſt the oppoſite curſes or privations thereof an Introduction thereunto) firſt make them ſenſible of the miſchiefes and inconveniencies which accrewed to a Nation through want thereof, <hi>whilſt there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> For <hi>in thoſe dayes</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>every man did that which was right in his own eyes,</hi> which right was meaſured by the law of their own luſts, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the <hi>Theft</hi> and Idolatry of <hi>Micah, Jud.</hi> 17.

Where mention is made of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114572:53"/>
that Court of Elders which was compoſed of the ſelect Elders of every tribe, which onely had cognizance of thoſe High and Capital offences; from which they undertook to free the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred exiled <hi>Benjamites,</hi> which none of the Inferior Courts of juſtice could do, which yet were not then wanting neither in all or moſt of the Cities in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as in <hi>Succoth, Judg.</hi> 8. And in that Citie which <hi>Boaz</hi> inhabited. <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. But although all theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magiſtracies and Courts of juſtice were then in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in every paſſage inculcateth the defect of a King to be the cauſe of thoſe many and grievous enormities and offences incurred by the People, which were the cauſe of many grievous judgements upon that Nation: For when they forſook the wayes of God and followed their own inordinate luſts, God likewiſe forſook them, giving them over to the luſts of heathen tyrants, and <hi>making them which hated them lords over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after God by his judgements had humbled them, and made them capable of the renewall of his mercy in their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it pleaſed the wiſdom of God alwaies to raiſe them ſome one man to be a <hi>Judge, Monarch,</hi> and <hi>Captain</hi> over them, by whoſe hand he wrought that deliverance for them; No doubt God could have wrought their deliverance by diverſe other meanes, as he did in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he delivered both King and people by an <hi>Angel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. Or in the dayes of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> when he ſlew the <hi>Amorites</hi> by hail-ſtones from Heaven, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 10.

Or as <hi>Chriſt</hi> delivered himſelf from the firſt attempt of the Soldiers who came to apprehend him, whom he overthrew with a blaſt of the breath of his mouth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.6. As he ſhal likewiſe overthrow <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and all his power at the laſt day, 2 <hi>Theſ,</hi> 2. But yet it pleaſed God in all their captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's and diſtreſſes, during thoſe ſinful times wherein they wanted a King and Regal Government, to raiſe them up occaſionall <hi>Monarchs</hi> and Judges for their occaſional deliverances, thereby to manifeſt unto them the benefit of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> and how conducent Regal and <hi>Monarchicall</hi> Government was to their conſtant ſecurity and happineſs.</p>

or bleſſing) to participate of ſome ſort of <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> (becauſe it did proceed from the wil of God, which is the Univerſal cauſe of all things except ſinne, of which it is onely a permiſſive cauſe, but of all other things an Efficient and Poſitive cauſe) which will of God is alſo the true and proper ground of <hi>Jus Divinum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore leaſt any man from thence ſhould erroniouſly imagine the curſe of <hi>Polarchie</hi> to be capable of ſome Divine ſanction, I wil here premiſe a more punctuall diviſion of that <hi>Jus Divinum Vindicativum</hi> which is Incident to <hi>Polarchie,</hi> which I mentioned in that Introduction, but referred the more punctuall explication thereof unto this place, for the very ſame reaſon which I there omitted the explication of <hi>Jus Divinum Naturale,</hi> which was a ſpecies of <hi>Jus Divinum Gratioſum,</hi> whereof <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> doth participate, as we have already ſhewed.</p>
               <p>You may remember that <hi>Jus Divinum Redemptivum</hi> (which is the onely <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> which hath now any Right or Title to a place in the Government and providence of God over both the Intellectual and Natural Agents) was diſtinguiſhed in that Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction in <hi>Gratioſum &amp; Vindicativum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Gratious Divine Right</hi> is that which is grounded upon the wil of God, concerning the Manifeſtation of his mercy, partly in the Renovation of thoſe Natural gifts and bleſſings unto man, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency did participate, as helpes and means for the performance of his Natural dutyes to God: Of which <hi>Jus Divinum Monarchie</hi> doth participate, as we have already manifeſted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Vindicative Divine Right</hi> (which indeed is properly a Divine Malediction) is that which is grounded upon the will of God, concerning the manifeſtation of his juſtice in the infliction of thoſe curſes and puniſhments which were the fruits of Divine Malediction, for the Apoſtaſie and diſloyalty of our firſt Parents. And this <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is two-fold, viz: <hi>Supernaturale &amp; Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Supernatural Divine Malediction,</hi> is that which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the wil of God, concerning the Manifeſtation of his juſtice in the Infliction of Spiritual and Supernatural judgements and curſes, which are the oppoſite privations of thoſe Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Spiritual bleſſings which Immediately relate unto
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114572:55"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this ſort of <hi>Vindicative Divine Right</hi> cannot claim any place in <hi>Polarchie,</hi> in regard it concernes men onely in their Spiritual and not in their Politick and ſociable capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Naturall Divine Malediction</hi> is that which is grounded upon the wil of God, concerning the Manifeſtation of his juſtice in thoſe judgments &amp; curſes, which are the oppoſite privations of natural gifts and bleſſings, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate, as helpes and meanes for the performance of his Natural dutyes to God. And this is that <hi>Divine Malediction</hi> which doth properly claim a place in <hi>Polarchie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dub.</hi> If either <hi>Monarchie</hi> be a bleſſing of God, or <hi>Polarchie</hi> a curſe of God, why then is not <hi>Monarchie</hi> Recorded amongſt the bleſſings which <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſation of their obedience? Nor <hi>Polarchy</hi> amongſt thoſe curſes wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> Menaced their diſobedience to Gods Laws and Statutes? <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in thoſe two Chapters mentions only thoſe beatitudes and curſes, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were at that time ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, that ſo the one ſort might be a Motive to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their dutyes to God, the other a Caution for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the contrary offences againſt God. But as yet the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were not truly ſenſible of the bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> (in that capacity which <hi>Iacobs</hi> propheſie had deſigned it for that Nation, which was that Royal Government wherein <hi>Judah</hi> of whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to deſcend, was to be honoured with the ſcepter and Supremacy.) Nor yet of the oppoſite curſe of <hi>Polarchy,</hi> and the manifold miſchiefes and inconveniences of the ſame; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, God did afterwards tutor them by many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Interregnums of their Judges, for that ſpace of three hundred thirty nine years, wherein the Nation was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely by occaſional <hi>Monarchs</hi> and Rulers. But afterwards when the appointed time was come, wherein God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to felicitate that Nation with the bleſſing of a conſtant <hi>Monarchie</hi> or Regal Government, you ſhal then find that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment honoured with many gracious promiſes: Onely indeed for the curſe of <hi>Polarchy,</hi> there is no ſpecies or ſort thereof, ſo much as once mentioned in the whole Scripture, neither before, nor in, nor after the time of their Regal Government. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114572:56"/>
whereof, was becauſe God had promiſed to preſerve the Prerogative Royal entire unto <hi>Judah,</hi> (and particularly unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> family) until <hi>Shiloh</hi> came, as it is manifeſt both in <hi>Iacobs</hi> propheſie, and Gods particular promiſes unto <hi>David;</hi> from whoſe ſonne <hi>Nathan,</hi> who was <hi>Solomons</hi> younger brother, <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended, whoſe Right and Title to that Kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth clearly manifeſt, ſhewing how <hi>Solomons</hi> houſe ended in <hi>Ieco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iah,</hi> and then how <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> who was the rightful Prince of <hi>Judah,</hi> as deſcended of <hi>Nathan,</hi> who was next heir to <hi>Solomon.</hi> And therefore though the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Cha.</hi> 3. and diverſe others of the Prophets did threaten many heavy judgements to fall upon the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their ſinnes by wicked and Tyrannical Kings, which accordingly came to paſſe by <hi>Ahaz, Manaſſes, Ammon, Ioachaz</hi> and all his ſucceſſours til the captivity; yet did none of them ever mention this curſe and judgement of <hi>Polarchy,</hi> &amp; that for this very cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But you wil ſay that cannot be the cauſe, for the ſcepter did depart from <hi>Judah</hi> and the family of <hi>David</hi> long before <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh</hi> came, for <hi>Atheliah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ahab</hi> reigned ſix yeares in <hi>Judah</hi> upon the death of her ſonne <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> and the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who ſlew <hi>Amaziah</hi> either reigned themſelves, or at leaſt did not ſuffer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> the true heire to that crown to reign, for the ſpace of eleven yeares. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. Nor was there ever any King of <hi>Judah</hi> which reigned over the <hi>Jewes</hi> after the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which fel out five hundred twenty ſix yeares before the birth of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and yet within that time the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſometimes had Kings over them, as <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> who was of the family of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and of the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> whoſe poſterity was rooted out by <hi>Antipater</hi> an <hi>Idumean</hi> (and a ſervant to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi>) of whom deſcended <hi>Herod,</hi> who was King of <hi>Judah</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There are two things to be regarded in all Gods tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall promiſes to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1. The ſubſtance of the promiſe, which was the Spiritual bleſſing principally intended by God, and in this God was alwayes very punctual in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and of this principally the promiſe of the ſcepter, and of the perpetuity of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne is to be underſtood, that is, of a Spiritual Kingdome; For ſuch a King <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, and ſuch
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114572:56"/>
a Kingdome <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely claimed, that is a Kingdome of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and of this Kingdome of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> there ſhall never be an end. And this ſcepter and the Prerogatives thereof, never departed from <hi>Judah</hi> til <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, for that Tribe enjoyed the Spiritual Prerogatives of the Goſpel (though under Types and Figures) and was not tranſferring from the <hi>Jewes</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> til after <hi>Chriſts</hi> death. 2. The ſhadow and type of the promiſe, which was the temporal bleſſing prefiguring and pointing out that Spiritual bleſſing, and in this God purpoſely failed the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> expectation oftentimes, thereby to draw their minds from temporal to Spiritual matters (which was the cauſe alſo why <hi>Chriſt</hi> never pretended to as earthly Kingdome, although he was truly and really heire to the Crown of <hi>Judah.</hi>) And though the actual adminiſtration of the outward ſcepter and ſupremacy promiſed to <hi>Judah</hi> was often Intermitted, for the foreſaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet was his actual Right and Title ſtil manifeſted by God, not onely by exact records of the genealogies of the Royal fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended, but alſo by ſevere judgements upon thoſe who preſumed to uſurp the ſcepter: For all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the <hi>Machabees</hi> dyed by the ſword, and their poſterity was rooted out (as you read before) by their own ſervant; And <hi>Herod</hi> in his latter dayes lived a miſerable life, and dyed a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death. So that even the temporal part of that promiſe of ſupremacy to <hi>Judah</hi> (which was the Type of the Spiritual) was performed exactly in the realty, though not in the Modality thereof, that is, in the manifeſtation of a clear and undoubted ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the crown, though not in the actual adminiſtration of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Authority, and the outward pomp which is an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage thereof. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> was proclaimed by <hi>Angels, King of the Jewes,</hi> as ſoone as he was born: Which muſt needs relate to his temporal Right, For in his Spiritual Right, he was King of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what that <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> is, whereof <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchy</hi> doth participate viz: <hi>Jus Divinum Vindicativum,</hi> which is indeed a <hi>Divine Malediction,</hi> for the further Illuſtration whereof, I will ſhew you firſt what <hi>Polarchy</hi> is in this preſent Chapter, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly how many ſeveral Maledictions are Incident thereunto, in the enſuing Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polarchy</hi> (in its proper genus) is neither deſcribed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114572:57"/>
nor any of thoſe Statiſts, who from his principles have framed diſcourſes thereupon, becauſe all of them proceed upon that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Policy, which Divinity manifeſteth to be falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious: For all of them generally take it <hi>pro Conceſſo,</hi> that theſe kinds of <hi>Polarchies</hi> (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placeth amongſt the laudable ſorts of Policy) are gifts and bleſſings of God as well as <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> and different onely in degrees of goodneſſe. All which <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchies</hi> out of the principles of Divinity &amp; warrant of Scripture (the onely infallible Rule and ground of truth) (and wherein a judicious Textuary ſhal find a more exact preſcript and Model of Policy and <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, then ever was ſet forth, either <hi>by Plato in his phanſied Republique, or Ariſtotle in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, or Xenophon in Cyropaedia, or Cicero, or Livie, or Dionyſius Halycarnaſſeus, or Cornelius Tacitus, or the moſt exact Polititian</hi> that ever writ purpoſely of this ſubject.) I place amongſt the curſes and judgements which God doth inflict upon a Nation for ſinne. And if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had wel conſidered the nature of a <hi>Polarchy</hi> (although he conſtitute but two ſpecies thereof, viz: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the Rule and Government of the Nobles. and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the Rule and Government of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The oppoſite privations whereof by his Doctrine are, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet) he ſhould have found <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchy</hi> directly capable of that boundles multiplicity which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf makes the reciprocal property of an evil, &amp; <hi>Monarchy</hi> of that ſimplicity which himſelf maks the reciprocal property of a good, according to that Maxime of his own <hi>Eth. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now it is apparent there can be but one ſort of <hi>Monarchie</hi> (I mean in relation to the ſubject of power and ſupremacy, which is the ground of variating the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Policy.) But there may be as many ſorts of <hi>Polarchies</hi> as there are People in a common-wealth. For by the ſame Rule that <hi>Rome</hi> erected three ſorts of <hi>Polarchy,</hi> they might as Legally haue erected thirty thouſand ſorts: For when they conſtituted two Conſuls, why might not they have conſtituted three, or four, or tenne, or a hundred, or indeed a hundred thouſand? and ſo in their Decemvirates, and Triumvirates, which were but meer devices without any grounds either in nature or Religion. But
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114572:57"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the ſixth Malediction Incident to Polarchy.</head>
               <p>COncerning the <hi>Divine Maledictions</hi> Incident to this curſe of <hi>Polarchy:</hi> It is neceſſary by the rule of contraries, that as the bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> doth participate of ſix ſeveral ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that the curſe of <hi>Polarchy</hi> ſhould participate of ſix ſeveral <hi>Maledictions;</hi> oppoſite to thoſe ſanctions. 1. Curſed Inſtitution. 2. Curſed Preſcription. 3. Curſed Stipulation. 4. Curſed Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilation. 5. Curſed Accomodation. 6. Curſed Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Malediction</hi> incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is a <hi>Curſed Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Original.</hi> I have often admired the groſſe miſtake of all thoſe Authors which I have read upon this ſubject, concerning both the time and manner of the Inſtitution of <hi>Polarchies,</hi> but eſpecially of that learned and judicious Statiſt Sir <note n="*" place="margin">Common-wealth of England: lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>13.</hi> and <hi>14.</hi>

                  <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> who makes all thoſe three kinds of Government, (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> termes the juſt and laudable ſorts of Policy) to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and Arbitrary, as if they had all an equal ground both in Divinity and nature, and that the ſole preheminence amongſt them, were onely in precedency of time: As if an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> had even naturally and of neceſſity ſucceeded a <hi>Monarchie</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond age of the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> and <hi>Democracie</hi> upon the like grounds obtained the like honour amongſt men of the third generation. Whereas firſt concerning the difference of their Antiquity, I am moſt aſſuredly confident that the learnedeſt Antiquarie in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114572:58"/>
world, cannot produce any Authentick Record to evidence the Original of any <hi>Polarchy,</hi> within the ſpace of three thouſand yeares, after the firſt Inſtitution of <hi>Monarchie</hi> by God in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> It is true indeed that God did Inſtitute the <hi>Synedrion</hi> or great Counſel of ſeventy Elders in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular orders of Magiſtracy in every Tribe and City, conſiſting of different numbers of Elders: but none of theſe were ordained with any intention to ſway the ſcepter of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or to exerciſe the ſupream Power and Authority of the Common-wealth: but onely for Inferior Courts of juſtice a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to that ſupream and Regal Honour and Power which God had deſigned for the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> And therefore from the time of their firſt Inſtitution under <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were alwaies ſubject to ſuch occaſional Judges, Rulers, and <hi>Monarchs,</hi> as God appointed to be ſupream Rulers and Governors over his people, as <hi>Ioſhua, Othniel, Ehud,</hi> and the reſt of the Judges.</p>
               <p>Indeed the firſt face of any Government which looks like a <hi>Polarchy,</hi> preſents it ſelf upon the death of <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> who was murdered by a conſpiracy of ſome of his Nobles, in the fifteenth year of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred and fifty years after the firſt inſtitution of a Regal Government in that Kingdome) whoſe ſonne <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was not admitted to his juſt and rightful inheritance, till the ſeven and twentieth year of the ſaid <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> During which time there was an Intermiſſion of Regal Government in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Judah;</hi> but who the Traytors were that withheld the King from his Right, and uſurped the Royal Power, the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> doth not ſpecify; how ever, it is not Improbable that thoſe conſpirators who ſlew his Father, might (according to the uſual Policy of Traytors) ſeek to ſecure themſelves from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for their offence, by their voluntary incurment of a more criminous guilt. Onely thus much I am aſſured of, that if this were the firſt Inſtitution of a <hi>Polarchy,</hi> the Devil was the Author of it; for the foundation of it was laid in Rebellion, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Uſurpation, which were never any of Gods works; or if no <hi>Polarchy</hi> can pretend to ſo great Antiquity, yet whenſoever the firſt was erected, I am ſure it had neither other foundation, nor other Author: For every lawful <hi>Monarch</hi> (which was the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114572:58"/>
and Primitive Government in every Kingdom of the world) was as Legally and juſtly poſſeſſed of his Crown, as any Private Gentleman is of a Lordſhip deſcended from his Anceſtors, or otherwiſe made his by any juſt and warrantable courſe of Law. And therefore as no Gentlemans Tenants can without manifeſt Injuſtice poſſeſſe themſelves of their Landlords lawful inheritance upon any Allegation that he is a hard maſter, or a deboiſt and lewd man, or any the like pretence, how true and juſt ſoever, no more can any ſubjects (having a greater obligation upon them of obedience to their King then any Tenants have to a Landlord) upon the like Allegation depoſe their Soveraign; and poſſeſſe themſelves of the Supremacy and Royal Power; without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt guilt of Rebellion, and Sacrilegious uſurpation in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree. And therefore all <hi>Polarchy</hi> muſt needs proceed from that old grand Rebel and Author of all miſchief the Devil; and whether he was not of councel with thoſe Senators who erected the firſt <hi>Polarchy</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> (which was one of the moſt ancient in the world) I ſhal deſire the Reader to judge by one act of thoſe Senators; concerning the buſineſſe of that pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government; for <hi>(ex pede Herculem)</hi> by their prudence, juſtice, and conſcience expreſſed in this one, you may judge of their grounds and reaſons for other of their actions. After theſe Reformers had baniſhed <hi>Tarquinius ſuperbus</hi> the Tyrant, they found one <hi>Tarquinius</hi> a Noble-man in <hi>Rome,</hi> who was a man of an exceeding upright and unblamable converſation, whom thoſe reforming politicians would not permit upon any intreaties or meanes that could be uſed, to live in <hi>Rome,</hi> although no man in the City could bring in any accuſation againſt him; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately baniſhed him alſo, becauſe they judged him to be a man of a dangerous and Tyrannical name, and therefore would not be perſwaded that Tyranny was ſufficiently extinguiſhed, whilſt there was any man of that name living in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as much juſtice, as if, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>ſtyles</hi> had killed a man, the King ſhould hang all <hi>Iohns</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to prevent <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>Malediction</hi> Incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is curſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; For we never find the curſe of <hi>Polarchy</hi> received by any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114572:59"/>
nation before <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, but onely Heathens and Infidels, to whom God never vouchſafed the underſtanding &amp; knowledge of divine Myſteries revealed in his word, (containing the Immediate outward meanes of ſalvation) Nor after <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, neither till of late yeares, which <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians</hi> make the declining and languiſhing age and ſtate of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> when <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties abounded with blaſphemous Hereſies in Doctrine, &amp; Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Innovations in Diſcipline, for the juſt puniſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God did ſend this curſe of <hi>Polarchy</hi> amongſt them; ſo that ſome Chriſtian ſocieties have now of late (through giddy fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick humours) by Heatheniſh preſidents erected ſome ſorts of <hi>Polarchies</hi> in their Common-wealths (which yet are none of the moſt eminent.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third <hi>Malediction</hi> Incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is Curſed ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf menacing the Eradication and utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of <hi>every plant which his Heavenly Father hath not plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Mat.</hi> 15.13. And that <hi>Polarchy</hi> is one of theſe unnaturall and ſpurious plants declared in the curſed Inſtitution thereof And though neither <hi>Polarchy</hi> in General, nor any ſpecies thereof, be once mentioned in the Scripture, (the reaſon whereof I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed) yet are thoſe curſed ſins which are both the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and aſſociates of all <hi>Polarchies</hi> (in any Kingdome of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and Antiquity) Stigmatized with many dreadful Menaces and <hi>Maledictions</hi> in ſeveral parts of Scripture, eſpecially Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (which is the conſtant foundation, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p of every Ancient and Eminent <hi>Polarchy</hi>) which the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> compares to witch-craft, which is an utter renunciation of all Relation to God, and obliging our ſelves by Covenant to be the children and ſervants of the Devil. And what rewards can ſuch men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their curſed vocation and profeſſion, but horror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience here to and horror of Helliſh and everlaſting torments hereafter?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth <hi>Malediction</hi> Incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is a curſed Aſſimilation, <hi>Polarchy</hi> being a reſemblance of the groſſeſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities both in <hi>Divinity, Nature, and Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Divinity,</hi> A multiplicity of Gods was an Abſurdity which not onely the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but even the wiſer and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114572:59"/>
more knowing ſort of Heathens (as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) did abominate and deride. And the Supreamacy in Government is the moſt Immediate reſemblance of Divine Majeſty upon earth, (For which cauſe the Kings in Scripture are ſtyled Gods) And therefore a multiplicity of Supream Rulers muſt needs be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and ridiculous abſurdity even by the judgement of the wiſer ſort of Heathens.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Polarchy</hi> is a reſemblance of the greateſt Abſurdity in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For though the body of man, which is the moſt exact Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Nature, conſiſts of two hands and Armes, and two feet and legs, and though each of them alſo have five toes and fingers, yet doth one head direct the actions and motions of all theſe. Nay though a man have moe fingers or moe toes then uſual, yet is not that eſteemed ſuch an abſurdity in Nature, as to have two heades: And certainly, the moe heades that a man hath, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter monſter he is; And the more Supream Governours there are in a ſtate, the more prodigious is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Polarchy</hi> is a reſemblance of the greateſt Abſurdity in <hi>Art.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum.</note> Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> when he endeavoured to perſwade the neceſſity of a <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government in the Church, and thereupon the neceſſity of Epiſcopacy, he ſhewed how both in Nature and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and <hi>Arts,</hi> all things tended to <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government. <hi>The dumb beaſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and wilde herds follow their leaders. The Bees have their King, and the Cranes flie after one another like an Alphabet of letters; one Emperour and one Judge of each province: Rome as ſoon as it was built, could not admit of two brethren to be Kings, and</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>fought in one womb. In a houſe is but one Maſter, in a ſhip but one Pilot; in an Army (though never ſo great) the ſigne of one Generall is expected.</hi> And what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies may accrew from diverſity of Generals in an Army, or the diverſity of Maſters in one family; the ſame and greater do accrew from diverſity of Supream Governours in one Common-wealth. By the Repreſentation of which Inconveniencies to the Authors own conſideration (who Importun'd <hi>Lycurgus</hi> for the erection of a <hi>Democratical</hi> government in the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Com: wealth) that prudent Prince quickly altered his deſires. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (ſaith he) do thou firſt make
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114572:60"/>
trial of that kind of Government in thine own family, and if thou find it advantagious to make thy ſervants Maſters of thy family, then renew this ſuit, and I wil hearken to it. But this injunction quite altered the caſe; For he that deſired to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above his own Maſter, had no deſire that his own ſervants ſhould be made Maſters and Rulers over himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth <hi>Malediction</hi> Incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is <hi>Curſed Acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, Polarchy</hi> being the moſt Commodious Inſtrument whereby the Devil may work diſcords and diviſions (which as I ſaid before, are the very <hi>morbi laethales populi &amp; Reipublicae.</hi>) For it is one of <hi>Chriſts</hi> own <hi>Maximes,</hi> that <hi>a Kingdome divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, Mat.</hi> 12.24. But every <hi>Polarchy</hi> muſt neceſſarily divide a Kingdome againſt it ſelf. <hi>Ergo.</hi> No Kingdome can continue under ſuch a Government but muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be brought to deſolation. The <hi>minor</hi> of that <hi>Sillogiſme</hi> is proved from another of <hi>Chriſts</hi> own <hi>Maximes, Mat.</hi> 6.24. <hi>No ſervant can ſerve two Maſters,</hi> (much leſſe three or four or four hundred Maſters) but in every <hi>Polarchy</hi> there are (at leaſt) two Maſters (and ſometimes many moe.) And therefore no man can be a true ſubject or ſervant in ſuch a Common-wealth, but (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith there) muſt neceſſarily be factions, by <hi>loving one and hating all others, and adhering to one, and rebelling againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Though a <hi>Polarchy</hi> be conſtituted of many Natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet all theſe are but one Politick body aggregated of thoſe many Natural bodies, and ſo in that ſenſe but one Politick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo may be ſerved: Becauſe though ſome differ in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſo in votes, yet the lawes by which they rule, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Major part, are the Act of the entyre body, and ſo obeyed as an unanimous Reſult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> If ever God had created one entire Politick and aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Soul, to act in that enitre Politick body, without a difference of opinions or affections; Or had by his lawes enjoyned us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and honour onely to an abſtract Power, and not to the ſubject in whom it is: Then ſuch a Politick body might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a Supreamacy of Power, to which men might exhibite obedience without neceſſity of Incurring the guilt of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any perſon Inveſted with that Supreamacy upon their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114572:60"/>
ſtrifes and diſſentions: But Gods Commandments enjoyne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Parents, not to paternity: to Kings, not to Regality: And therefore (ſeeing diverſe Kings have diverſe ſoules, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers minds, from whence do iſſue diverſe commands, which are alwayes inconſiſtent with a perfect obedience) it is impoſſible for one man to ſerve and obey both as a faithful and dutiful ſubject and ſervant.</p>
               <p>And this is that known principle which is aſſerted both by <note n="b" place="margin">in Cap. <hi>1.</hi> ad Titum, &amp; Ep. ad Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grium.</note>

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, (although a favourer of <hi>Polarchy</hi>) to be the ground of al miſchiefes and Inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine diſſentions in <hi>Polarchies, Diverſe men have divers mindes and divers meanings, and therefore amongſt a multitude of Governours, Emulation and Diſſention are no rare ſprings. Nay (both Jerom and Cyprian) record it for a probatum in daily experience, that ſo many leaders, ſo many followers; ſo many Rulers, ſo many factions do teare and rent in pieces the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of all ſocietyes:</hi> To which agrees <hi>Calvin,</hi> affirming <hi>an equality amongſt Governours to be the Mother of Factions.</hi> And therefore it is obſervable that in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, when <hi>Eſay</hi> had propheſied that there ſhould be an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal peace over the whole earth, that then there was not any kind of <hi>Polarchy</hi> in any Kingdome of the world: Becauſe a <hi>Polarchy</hi> in its own nature is inconſiſtent with Peace and Unity: And therefore the end and concluſion of all <hi>Polarchies</hi> is Ruine and Deſolation, (the common fate of all divided Kingdomes) if the mercy of God do not prevent the ſame, by the opportune Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of that <hi>Polarchical</hi> Government to a <hi>Monarchical;</hi> a manifeſt experience whereof we have both in the <hi>Athenian, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſan, Lacedemonian, and Romane Common-wealths;</hi> whoſe <hi>Polar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi> diſsentions occaſioned many Inteſtine warres and Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conflicts, which in <hi>fine</hi> muſt neceſsarily have produced the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and Deſolation of them all, if the Reducement of thoſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchies</hi> to <hi>Monarchies</hi> had not prevented it. For if <hi>Ceſars Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> had not been eſtabliſhed by the overthrow of <hi>Pompey</hi> (one of his fellow triumvirs, as peremptorily reſolved to endure no Superior, as <hi>Ceſar</hi> was to admit of no equall.) And the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Octavius Auguſtus,</hi> by the overthrow of <hi>Anthonie</hi> (a <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler competitor</hi>) what can any man imagine in probability to have proved the concluſion of thoſe <hi>Polarchical</hi> differences, but the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114572:61"/>
utter ruine and deſolation of that flouriſhing and renowned Common-wealth? For if you read <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> De Bell. Juda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> you ſhall find that the ruine and deſolation of that famous nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> was occaſioned rather by the civil, Inteſtine and bloody diſsentions of the three factions in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> created by the <hi>Tritarchie of Simon, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Eleazer;</hi> then either by the valour or policy of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. Solomon</hi> (himſelf a King) ſaith, that <hi>where no Councel is the people fall, but in the multitude of Councellours there is ſafety. Prov.</hi> 11.14. Whereby it appeares that the ſecurity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is more or leſs, according to the greater or leſser number of Councellors. Now you know, in a <hi>Monarchie</hi> the people are ruled by the wiſdome and prudence of one man, but in a <hi>Polarchy</hi> by the wiſdome and prudence of a multitude. Therefore <hi>ſalus populi</hi> is better provided for in a <hi>Polarchy;</hi> And by conſequence a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchy</hi> is the better Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There are two ſorts of Councellours. 1. Subordinate and obeying Councellours, the approbation of whoſe Councels depend upon a ſuperior <hi>Monarch;</hi> and a multitude of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours <hi>Solomon</hi> found by experience to be exceedingly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the ſafety of the people, and the honour of the King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Supream and ruling Councellours, the reſults of whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were ſufficient for the conſtitution of a decree or Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of any Superior <hi>Monarch.</hi> And ſuch Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors as theſe <hi>Solomon</hi> had no experience, nor thought of. Now there are two reaſons why the Councels of the former are to be preferred to the Councels of the latter ſort of Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe thoſe Councels which proceed from ſubjects, have the advantage of two oppoſite dangers, of each ſide one, to guide their Councels in the ſafe way of Moderation, between the Kings Prerogative, and the Peoples ſafety and benefit. Firſt the danger of ſelf-prejudice, being equally intereſted with the People in the grievances and ſufferings which proceed from the Tyranny of an unlimited (or rather an unduly limited) prerogative, by Lawes which may tend to the oppreſſions of the ſubjects in their eſtates or perſons, not warrantable by any Law of God, which obligeth the King in a Reciprocal bond of love, to regard
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114572:61"/>
the peoples ſafety as wel as they are obliged to regard his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And therefore no wiſe men wil adminiſter any Councel of this nature, which is deſtructive to themſelves as wel as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Secondly the danger both of the Kings diſpleaſure and the fruſtration and rejection of their Councels, if they ſhould preſent any advice to the King which tended to his own diſhonour, or to diſinable him for the protection of his people. But the Councels which proceed from a multitude of Governours have neither of theſe bridles to guide them in an equal and moderate way. For though their Councels be never ſo prejudicial to the Common-wealth, yet they have no Superior whoſe diſpleaſure they are afraid of. And as for the ſufferances and oppreſſions of the people, it is the Baſis and ſupport of their greatneſſe and Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Whatſoever the Councels be which are given to a King, yet his Reſolutions may be as exorbitant as the Reſults of theſe ruling Councelours: For the oppreſſions and grievous impoſitions which are laid upon the people, are his benefit, as wel as they are the benefit of Ruling Councellors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The caſe is much different. For the Honour and Power of a King (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is in the multitude of his people, and the wealth of a King in the proſperity and riches of his people, becauſe they have all an equal relation of ſubjection and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the King. But the Power and ſafety of the Supream Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers is in the multitude of their factious friends, and paucity of their adverſaries of a contrary faction. For (as we formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated from <hi>Chriſts</hi> own words and <hi>Maximes</hi>) it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but there muſt be ſome differences and diviſions in every <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchy,</hi> which though they be ſmothered for a while, (either through fear of a common enemy, or ſome other reſpects of common advantage) yet wil burſt out at length; when the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent care &amp; regard of the different Governours, wil not be to ſee the people numerous or wealthy, but their friends numerous and wealthy; &amp; their enemies few &amp; miſerable. And the prevalency of malice makes alwayes this latter their greateſt &amp; chiefeſt care: ſo that by the ſeveral Governours of different factions, the calamity and overthrow of the whole Commonwealth, comes at laſt to be the chiefeſt and Univerſal care and endeavour in every <hi>Polarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon why the Councels of a multitude of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114572:62"/>
are more conducible to the happineſſe both of the King and people, then the councels of a multitude of Rulers, is becauſe the Lawes which are compiled and framed by their councels, are grounded upon the validity of their reaſons and grounds which ſatiſfie the Kings judgement, though they proceed but from the ſingle opinion and vote of one, and one though the opinions and votes of four hundred others bee contradictory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; whereas the Lawes that are framed by the other Councels are grounded onely upon the multiplicity of votes, although they be never ſo abſurd: and how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd the votes of the Major part may be in a multitude, yea even of the chief and principal amongſt them, the Scripture affords us plentiful teſtimony; For in the caſe of the two <hi>Angels,</hi> all the men of <hi>Sodome</hi> voted againſt one <hi>Lot. Gen.</hi> 18. And ſix hundred thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> voted againſt one <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Deifying of the golden Calf. <hi>Ex.</hi> 32. <hi>Baal</hi> had four hundred and fifty votes to be the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf had only <hi>Elijah's.</hi> 1 King. 18. And <hi>Ahab</hi> obtained four hundred votes for his ſafe return from <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> when onely <hi>Micajah</hi> did vote againſt it, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. Nay did not all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> and multitudes of people vote <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf to be a grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and Delinquent, even worthy of death? <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. And therefore you ſee where the energy of a Law doth depend total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the multiplicity of votes, how ordinary and frequent it is, even for the moſt abſurd Impieties, and the moſt deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to attain the preheminence, either through the ſimplicity or partiality of judgements, which is never wanting in a <hi>Polarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixt and laſt <hi>Malediction</hi> Incident to <hi>Polarchy</hi> is curſed <hi>Regulation:</hi> Every <hi>Polarchical</hi> action in the <hi>Polarchs</hi> (who are Intereſted in the active part of Government) being rebellious &amp; intruſive both in the Inſtitution and management of a <hi>Polarchical</hi> Government, (in Relation to the lawful <hi>Monarch,</hi> who is by them depoſed from and deprived of his juſt and Legal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and birth-right) and factions and ſeditions in relation to the ſubjects. And directlie contrary to Gods Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And the actions of the <hi>Polarchiſts</hi> (who are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the paſſive part of Government) muſt needs be of the ſame nature, ſo farre as they are conſenting and aſſiſting unto
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114572:62"/>
their uſurping Governours in theſe <hi>Polarchical</hi> and ſinful actions. But I deſire the Reader to conſider that my diſcourſe relates to Ancient Common-wealthes, and not to our new <hi>Plantations,</hi> who may indeed erect a <hi>Polarchy</hi> without any guilt of Rebellion or intruſion upon another mans right, becauſe happily the places may be void of Inhabitants, and ſo void of all Government: But yet thoſe <hi>Polarchyes</hi> cannot be free from ſuch factions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> doth make Eſſential, even to the leaſt <hi>Polarchy,</hi> (though it be but onely <hi>Oeconomical</hi>) And a <hi>minore ad majus</hi> the common principles of a Logick make a valid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe grounds I conclude all <hi>Polarchies</hi> of what kind ſoever, to proceed from <hi>Divine Malediction,</hi> and therefore to be directly a curſe and judgement of God upon a Nation. And that therefore the vocation and profeſſion of <hi>Polarchs</hi> is curſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unwarrantable by the word of God, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their partakers. And I hope there is ſufficient matter alledged in the premiſes, to warrant this concluſion. And yet to adde a greater luſtre to this truth, I ſhall in the next Chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve two queries or caſes of conſcience concerning theſe two oppoſite kinds of Government viz: the bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> and curſe of <hi>Polarchy.</hi>

               <p>I Confeſſe the caſes of conſcience which may be propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe two oppoſite kinds of Government are very numerous: But yet I ſuppoſe a judicious Reader may frame a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of any one, or all of them, out of the premiſes, together with what I ſhal further adde in the reſolution of the two ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent quaeries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Quaere Whether a</hi> Monarch <hi>or King and his people may not (either ſeverallie or by joynt conſent) endeavour the change of that Government into a</hi> Polarchy (ſalvis utriuſque partis conſcientijs) <hi>when there appeares a manifeſt cauſe for ſo doing. As in the King, a conſciouſneſſe of his own diſability to execute the dutyes of his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114572:63"/>
calling. In the people a ſenſe of their own ſufferings, under an evill and Tyrannicall Government, the fruits of that diſability.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This querae conſiſts of 3. parts. 1. Concerns the King ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally. 2. Concerns the people ſeverally. 3. Concernes both King and people joyntly: unto each of which parts I ſhall frame a ſeverall anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kings ſole endeavours for ſuch a change, do render him guilty of a five-fold iniurie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To himſelf, which is the moſt unnaturall kind of obloquie, &amp; therefore an offence of the higheſt nature amongſt thoſe which relate immediately to man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To his poſterity, wherein the Holy Ghoſt declares him more notoriouſly criminous then an Infidell. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. For an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell is even naturally ſtudious to preſerve the honour both of himſelf, his poſterity and family.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the renunciation whereof, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (in the prementioned Text) imputes to him who doth renounce that Legal Authority and Power, wherewith God hath inveſted him for the juſt defence of that faith; according to <hi>Eſaiah's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Cha.</hi> 49 23. <hi>Kings ſhal be thy nurſing Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To the Saints and Church of <hi>Chriſt, whoſe wants ought to be ſupplyed out of his abundance,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 9. Ch.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To his people, changing their bleſſing into a curſe.</p>
               <p>As for the Kings diſabilities, It was never intended by the Law either of God or man, that they ſhould be the ground and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Power and Prerogative, for then moſt Kings ſhould transferre their Supreamacy in matters civil unto the Lawyers, and in Eccleſiaſtical unto the Divines; whereas both Divine and humane Lawes inveſt the King with a Supreamacy in both, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing the ſupply of his defects in either, by a Councel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the moſt knowing men in both Lawes, Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical. For which the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf ſupplyed us with a preſident in the <hi>Jewiſh Sanedrim,</hi> which was the great Councel inſtituted by God himſelf, (to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in matters of Importance and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty (when ſuch grew numerous) and after him all the <hi>Judges, Monarchs,</hi> and <hi>Kings of Iſrael</hi>) which Councel conſiſted both of prieſts and Princes or chief Elders in every tribe, as you may read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:114572:63"/>2. <hi>Sol.</hi> The peoples ſole endeavour for tranſmutation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie</hi> into <hi>Polarchy</hi> cannot be free from a triple guilt. 1. Of injuſtice to their own ſelves, in depriving themſelves of that which God ordained for a bleſſing and a meanes of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſecurity, and contracting upon themſelves that curſe, which is the fruits of <hi>Divine Malediction,</hi> and ordained by God for a Puniſhment of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of Manifeſt Diſobedience to the Kings Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in acting things contrary to his commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of Manifeſt injuſtice to his perſon, by intruding upon his juſt and lawfull Inheritance.</p>
               <p>As for the peoples ſufferings by the Kings evil and Tyrannicall Government, that can be no ground or warrant for them to act any thing prohibited by the Lawes of God; For though ſuch ſufferings be <hi>Mala poenoe,</hi> that is afflictions and puniſhments, from which we are taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to pray deliverance, and from which we ought alſo to endeavour a deliverance by all ſuch lawful meanes as are warrantable by the word of God: Yet in regard all <hi>Mala poenae</hi> are a part of Gods juſtice, whereby he is honoured: And all <hi>Mala culpae</hi> (ſuch as diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Authority, and the endamagement of our neighbour (much more of our Soveraign) in his eſtate or honour) are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of Gods precepts, wherein God is diſhonoured, and the Devil, the fleſh, and the world preferred before and above him. No man ought to endeavour a deliverance from the moſt horrid Tyranny and oppreſſion, by the leaſt act of injuſtice or rebellion.</p>
               <p>As for the arguments and objections alledged by the oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this doctrine to legitimate their acts of injuſtice and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, under the pretences of ſelf-defence; I ſhal recite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the moſt material of them in the eleventh <hi>Ch.</hi> of this book, which ſpeaks of the ſubordination of the ends of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting alſo the Kings Honour to have the Right of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; <hi>ante ſalutem populi,</hi> that is, above the peoples welfare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sol.</hi> The joynt endeavours of both (although they carry the faireſt ſhew of equity and conſcience, in regard there is no injuſtice done, but to thoſe that are willing to receive it, who by <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> rule, are incapable of an injury; (but that muſt be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114572:64"/>
underſtood <hi>ab Extrinſeco,</hi> and in <hi>foro judicij,</hi> yet) are altogether unwarrantable in this caſe; For firſt they are directly felons <hi>de ſe,</hi> and as guilty of ſelf-robbery as he that kils himſelf, is of ſelf murder. As we ſhewed in the two former anſwers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are guilty of moſt notorious Ingratitude and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, in deſpiſing his bleſſings, and preferring thoſe curſes before them, which are the badges of their <hi>ſinn,</hi> and of Gods wrath and vengeance for the ſame. Juſt like the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ungrateful <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who (whilſt they were fed with bread from Heaven) cryed out for returning to the fiſh, garlick, onyons, and cucombers of <hi>Egypt. Num.</hi> 11.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Quaere. Whether both</hi> Polarchs (<hi>that is, the Governours and Rulers in a</hi> Polarchy) <hi>and</hi> Polarchiſts, <hi>(that is, the ſubjects who live under ſuch Rulers) be joyntly and ſeverally obliged in conſcience to endeavour the Reducement of that Government to a</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To frame a reſolution to this queſtion, we muſt premiſe ſome diſtinctions of <hi>Polarchy;</hi> For though all <hi>Polarchies</hi> in their proper conſtitution be <hi>mala poenae</hi> and curſes for ſinne, yet do they admit of diverſe qualifications in relation to their Inſtitution and Original. For ſome ſorts are erected upon a more Legal and warrantable, or rather indeed a leſs ſinfull ground then others are.</p>
               <p>The ſafer and more warrantable grounds are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Plantation where there are no Inhabitants, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kind of Government, but the Election and Reſolution of any kind, is free and Arbitrary to that ſociety (who conſent for the population of the place, and the Inſtitution of a Policy) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſsent or prejudice of any other in Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſent of the <hi>Monarch</hi> or Governour in Authority, to chang that Government, either in part (as when any City, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or Kingdome under the command of ſome great King or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> doth obtaine (either by compoſition or donation) a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from all ſubjection unto the juriſdiction of that King, and thereupon do conferre the Supream Power over that ſociety up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moe then one) or in whole (as when both <hi>Monarch</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by joynt conſent do change a <hi>Monarchie</hi> into a <hi>Polarchy.</hi>)</p>
               <p>In all which ſorts of <hi>Polarchy,</hi> both <hi>Polarchs</hi> and <hi>Polarchiſts</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:114572:64"/>
are obliged in conſcience to endeavour the reducement of that Government to a <hi>Monarchie</hi> by all lawful meanes; But in this caſe all endeavours are not lawful; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt indeed all <hi>Polarchs</hi> which are intereſted in the active part of Government, are obliged in conſcience to endeavour this tranſmutation by any meanes which are conducent and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall thereunto; becauſe firſt, their actions are not liable to the guilt of rebellion, 2. They are Intruſted by the people, (who are their Electors) to councel and act thoſe things wherein they may beſt provide for the peace and ſafety of the people: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding happily thoſe things which they reſolve and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, ſometimes may not arride the Major part of the ignorant multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Every man is bound in conſcience in the firſt place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his own honour and benefit, and therefore theſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours cannot be obliged to endeavour this mutation, thereby to deveſt themſelves of the honour and benefit of ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of a care to provide for the good and benefit of the people rather then of themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol,</hi> It muſt be in things lawful and warrantable that men muſt ſeek honour and benefit; for no man ought in purſuance of thoſe ends, to make a vocation and calling of any thing which is in it ſelf a curſe and puniſhment, (as <hi>Polarchy</hi> is already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be) neither ought any man to endeavour a private good, out of that which is a publique and National damage and miſchief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The endeavours of all <hi>Polarchiſts,</hi> (who are Intereſted onely in the Paſſive part of Government.) For ſuch a Reducement, muſt be onely prayers to God, and petitions to Superiors, and ſuch meanes as do not tranſgreſſe the rules of obedience; For all <hi>Polarchiſts</hi> are equally engaged to the obedience of all thoſe <hi>Polarchs,</hi> as the ſubjects of a <hi>Monarch</hi> are to their King, they all being Inveſted with a ſupremacy of Power, in which reſpect they repreſent the Majeſty of God, and therefore all acts of reſiſtance or diſhonour to them, are diſhonourable to God, &amp; damnable to the reſiſters. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. Now all ſuch acts being <hi>Mala Culpae</hi> and Eſſentially evil: And <hi>Polarchy,</hi> (which we ſeek to avoid) being but <hi>Malum poenoe</hi> and accidentally evil; nor the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114572:65"/>
bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie</hi> (which we ſeek to attain) but accidentally good, we ought not to endeavour the attaining of any ſuch good, or deliverance from any ſuch evil, by acting any thing which may be prejudicial to our neighbour, or diſhonourable to God; For <hi>we may not do evil that good may come thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere.</hi> But put the caſe, that there happen a diviſion and diſſention between the <hi>Polarchs</hi> about this Reducement of ſuch a <hi>Polarchy</hi> to a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> ſome conſenting to it, others not: Ought not the ſubjects in ſuch a caſe to aſſiſt that party whoſe endeavours they judge to tend to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, againſt thoſe Governours who Impede and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Theſe diviſions and diſſentions are the very calamities which our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf affirmeth to be the Inſeparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and individual concomitants of <hi>Polarchy. Mat.</hi> 6.24. But for the ſubjects aſſiſtance of ſuch divided parties in a <hi>Polar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> (whether the diſſentions ſpring from that or any other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) it is utterly unlawful and contrary to the commands of God. For though both parties be our Superiours; and we obliged to the obedience of both, yet not to the active obedience of either party, where both their Commands enjoyn a ſinful action. Now that aſſiſtance of one party cannot be free from the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and oppoſition of others, who are inveſted with an equal Power and Authority over us, and by conſequence not free from ſinne: And therefore we may not aſſiſt in ſuch a caſe, by any other endeavours then our prayers, nor is any way ſafe and free from ſinne in ſuch a caſe, but a paſſive obedience to both, by ſuffering with patience (as from the hand of God,) whatſoever ſhal be inflicted upon us by either party amongſt ſuch divided Powers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The moſt unwarrantable and wicked grounds for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a <hi>Polarchy,</hi> are Rebellion and injuſtice, when ſubjects revolt, and renounce their alleigance to their lawful King and <hi>Monarch,</hi> either in part (by the rebellion and diſloyalty of ſome particular City, Province, or Kingdome under his command) or in whole (by the violent depoſition of the King or <hi>Monarch,</hi> from his total Power and Authority, and the abſolute deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, of all his Rights and Dominions.) In both which the caſe is the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:114572:65"/>Again, a <hi>Polarchy</hi> which is thus erected may be conſidered three wayes. 1. In order to thoſe <hi>Polarchs</hi> and <hi>Polarchiſts,</hi> who are the Original Authors thereof, in all and every one of which that foundation is wicked and ſinful, proceeding from a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a precept comprehended within the firſt Table of the Moral Law, which is not capable of Legitimation by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>ſe defendi</hi> (as I ſhall fully demonſtrate in the eleventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of this Book,) from whence I conclude, that all thoſe <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchs</hi> and <hi>Polarchiſts</hi> are joyntly and ſeverally obliged to imploy their utmoſt endeavours for the Reducement of that <hi>Polarchy</hi> to the <hi>Priſtine</hi> Government, by reſtitution of their Lawful Soveraign to his juſt Power, and his proper Rights and Revenues; The detaining of the latter being manifeſt injuſtice, and the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the former manifeſt Rebellion, for ſuppreſſing whereof (in regard (as I ſaid before, and ſhall in the eleventh Chapter fully prove) it is a ſinne Immediately againſt the Honour of God) every man ought to engage both his life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In order to thoſe <hi>Polarchs</hi> and <hi>Polarchiſts,</hi> who are the maintainers and managers of ſuch a <hi>Polarchy,</hi> during the life of that King or of any other of the Blood-Royal; who, (by deſcent from him) can make a juſt claim and title unto that Crown. And all theſe are partakers of the ſame ſinnes with their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; who were the Original Authors thereof; and therefore equally obliged to the like reducement which the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In order to thoſe <hi>Polarchs</hi> &amp; <hi>Polarchiſts</hi> who are ſurvivers to all the blood-Royal, in whom the caſe comes to be the ſame with thoſe which we formerly mentioned, living under a <hi>Polarchy</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without oppoſition. For where the Blood-Royal is abſolutely extinct, God doth thereby declare his wil concerning the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that family from the Government, as in the caſes of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> (though it be effected by never ſo wicked inſtruments) and the ſubjects thereby freed from all obligation of obedience to that family, and obliged to ſuch an obedience to the preſent Governours (though <hi>Polarchs</hi>) and ſuch a Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that to a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as may not render them guilty of any act of reſiſtance or oppoſition to thoſe <hi>Polarchical</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114572:66"/>
For as he that is lame in his legs and feet (which are gifts of nature) may lawfully uſe crutches, til it pleaſe God to reſtore him to his native perfection. So muſt ſubjects be content to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe this curſe and puniſhment of a <hi>Polarchy,</hi> til it pleaſe God to reſtore them unto the bleſſing of <hi>Monarchie;</hi> but we muſt not ſeek to regain it by rebellion or any ſinful meanes, for that is to forſake God, and to runne to the Devil for help and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from our griefes and afflictions.</p>

               <p>But whether it be lawful to compaſſe a Crown <hi>per fas aut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas,</hi> is not the point in queſtion; for all men (who underſtand any thing in Religion and Chriſtianity) do acknowledge that no man ought to uſurp the Crown or Regal Government, but he who is Legally inveſted with that ſupremacy, which creates a Right and Title thereunto. But from whence the inveſtiture of that ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is derived, is the point in difference. For the true ſtating and deciſion whereof, we muſt obſerve in the firſt place, that there is a two-fold ground and cauſe of this ſupremacy, <hi>viz:</hi> Principal and Inſtrumental.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Principal, and that is God; by whom all Power is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. For he is the Univerſal principal and primary cauſe (both efficient and final) of all things (ſin only excepted) <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:114572:66"/>2. Inſtrumental, which is the ſecondary meanes which God doth make uſe of, for the Immediate collation of this ſupremacy upon any man, whereby to entitle him to the Regal diademe: and this again is two-fold, <hi>viz:</hi> Extraordinary and Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1, Extraordinary, when God doth declare his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure concerning the advancement of any perſon to this Soveraign Power and preheminence by Extraordinary revelations, and this again is two-fold, <hi>viz:</hi> Gratious and Vindicative.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gratious, when the Lord doth thus declare his wil by Angel or Prophet, or ſome ſuch Extraordinary meanes, for the advancement of a perſon to this honour; for a bleſſing to his people, by making him a Miniſter of favours and mercies, as in <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, David, Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Vindicative, when Gods wil is ſo declared concerning the advancement of ſuch a perſon, whom he doth make the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of his curſes and judgements, for a puniſhment of their ſinnes, as in <hi>Jeroboam, Jehu, Salmaneſer King of Aſſyria, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchad-nezzer King of Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Ordinary, when God doth advance a man to this Regal dignity and honour by thoſe ordinary wayes and meanes which are conſtant Rules for us to judge of, whereby to acknowledge this ſoveraignty and yeeld our obedience, &amp; this likewiſe is two-fold, <hi>viz:</hi> Gratious and Vindicative.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Gratious, when the ſoveraign Power is attained by thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes and meanes which are approved and warranted by the word of God, and the Rules of reaſon and equity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vindicative, when the ſame Power is attained by violence and Injuſtice, and ſuch curſed wayes and meanes as are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God, and the Rules of juſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p>The diſpute of the former would be arrogant and impious, for the Extraordinary wayes of God are farre above our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and further above our Imitation. For God never intended ſuch for a preſident whereby to frame our actions, but onely our ſubmiſſions thereunto. And therefore paſſing over them, I ſhall inſiſt onely upon thoſe ordinary meanes which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be a Rule for our actions in this kind <hi>(i. e.)</hi> both for a ground of the <hi>Monarchs</hi> claim and Title to the ſoveraignty, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114572:67"/>
alſo for the peoples ſubmiſſion and obedience to the perſon, who is diſtinguiſhed from, and preheminenced above all others in that ſociety, by a lawful Right and Title to the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ordinary meanes (as you heard) is two-fold, <hi>viz,</hi> Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Vindicative.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Gratious, when the meanes are approved and warranted by the word of God, concerning which there are two different opinions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The former (which I confeſſe is atteſted by ſome Authors of eminency) is, that the Right of the Royal Inveſtiture pertaineth to the people: Whereof in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The latter more truly doth impute it to Birth-right and Hereditary ſucceſſion: Whereof in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Arguments whereupon they ground the former opinion, are partly Inſtantial, partly Rational.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Inſtances alledged for the propugnation thereof, are the Inaugurations of thoſe Kings which the Scriptures mention to be made or anointed by the people, as <hi>Saul</hi> concerning whom (the Text ſaith) that <hi>all the people of the land came to Gilgal to make him King.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.15. And David, <hi>which all the men of Judah anointed King at Hebron.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4. And who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was <hi>anointed King over Iſrael at Hebron by all the Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> 2.5.3. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was likewiſe anointed by the people. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.22. And <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom the people made King over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12, 20. And <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah whom the people of the land made King.</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 14.21. And <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz,</hi> who (though he was but the ſecond ſonne of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> younger then <hi>Eliakim) was made King by the people in his fathers ſtead.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.20. And <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom the people inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have made a King. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. And it muſt needs be preſuppoſed they had a power to do ſo, otherwiſe their attempts had been ridiculous. And to adde further weight to this Argument, we find this act of the peoples in making and anointing of Kings to be mentioned ſometimes with an expreſſe approbation thereof from God, as upon <hi>Sauls</hi> Inveſtiture. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.14. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> received this honour from the people by the <hi>Lords</hi> expreſſe Command, enjoyning <hi>David</hi> to go to <hi>Hebron,</hi> there to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114572:67"/>
King by the people. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. And <hi>David</hi> himſelf <hi>called all the people to the anointing of King Solomon.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon alledged for the ground of this opinion, is, that the honour and ſubmiſſion which Kings receive, is Originally in the people, (for <hi>honor eſt in honorante, &amp; non in honorato,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> principles) and from them derived unto the King. And therefore they do not conceive it juſt or reaſonable that the people ſhould be obliged to yeeld honour, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and performe dutyes of obedience to any perſon, but him whom themſelves ſhall judge worthy of it: And ſo atteſt their judgement of his worth, by their election of him to be their King and Soveraign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To theſe we may adde Saint <hi>Peters</hi> teſtimony, who termes Regality <hi>an Ordinance of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. which were falſe, if it did proceed from God, and not from the people; for then it were an ordinance of God and not of man: And therefore though God be the Vniverſal cauſe of Royal Power, as he is of all things elſe, yet the people muſt be the Immediate and particular cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe gounds they deduce two damnable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Inferences and Corollaries to juſtifie Rebellion, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronement of Kings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though the King be <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> yet he is <hi>minor Vniverſis;</hi> and therefore that it is no Rebellion but duty in the people (meaning the Major part) to reſiſt or depoſe the King, where the people judge it neceſſary in relation to the defence of their own ſafety, which (according to their Doctrine) is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema Lex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the King doth receive and enjoy this honour onely by virtue of a ſtipulation or Covenant between himſelf and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (the ſole ground whereof they conclude to be <hi>ſalus populi.</hi>) And therefore if the King doth violate this Covenant, and break the truſt repoſed in him by the people, by any acts which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive <hi>ad ſalutem populi,</hi> (whereof they preſuppoſe the people to be the Judges) that then the people are abſolved from their Alleagance grounded upon that truſt and Covenant, and may lawfully provide for their own ſafety and welfare, either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, depoſition, dethronement, or any ſuch meanes as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114572:68"/>
judge to be moſt conducent to their owne ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Before I returne particular anſwers to theſe Inſtances, and the reaſon alledged for the peoples right to confer this ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, (which doth preheminence the King above all others in the ſame ſociety, and is the ground of the <hi>Monarchs</hi> title to his Crown) and the two damnable Inferences thence) I will premiſe thoſe grounds and reaſons which enunciate the errour and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this opinion. And thereupon frame anſwers to all that is or (I ſuppoſe) can be alledged for the ſupport of that popular prerogative.</p>
               <p>The Arguments declaring the errour and abſurdity of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion are partly Inſtantial, partly Rational.</p>
               <p>The Inſtances of Scripture are of two ſorts; the firſt manifeſt the peoples diſprobations not to be Authentick to Illegitimate the title of a lawful King or <hi>Monarch.</hi> For the Books of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> record ten ſeveral diſprobations and murmurings of the people againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet did not all theſe diſannul <hi>Moſes</hi> his Title; For we ſee with what fearful judgements upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf did Vindicate the ſame. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Num.</hi> 12. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. And all the people of the land from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> rejected <hi>David</hi> upon <hi>Abſaloms</hi> conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, yet did not that nullifie <hi>Davids</hi> Right and title to the Crown, for he was juſtly and truly King when he fled but with ſix hundred of his ſervants, and the <hi>Lord</hi> did afterwards Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Right and title thereunto by a mighty deſtruction of his enemies. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. Neither did the peoples diſprobation of his juſt Power (when the ten tribes forſook <hi>David</hi> and followed <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bichri</hi>) unking <hi>David,</hi> or Illegitimate his Right and title to the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For the <hi>Lord</hi> did quickly judge his cauſe by a ſuddaine vengeance upon that traitor, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Inſtances, manifeſt the peoples approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and endeavours not to be Authentick or effectual to create a lawful title to the Crown, for the golden Calf was honoured and received, and proclaimed a God and guide in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtead by <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> Yet did not that popular election legitimate that Calfs power and title. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Abſalom</hi> was proclaimed King by all the thouſands of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet did not that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114572:68"/>
act of the peoples legitimate <hi>Abſaloms</hi> title to the Crown. For the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> termeth it but a conſpiracy when it was in the very height. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Sheba</hi> had ten Tribes for him, when <hi>David</hi> had but one for him; and yet was he never termed a King, but <hi>a man of Belial.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. <hi>Adonijah</hi> confeſſeth that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>faces of all Iſrael were ſet on him, to make him King,</hi> yet) he never had any juſt Right or title to the Kingdome, becauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> had deſigned it for his Brother <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſons evincing the errour and abſurdity of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is taken from the nature of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> to which this opinion is abſolutely deſtructive: For it is the very Eſſence of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> that one man ſhould enjoy the ſupremacy; but if the ſupremacy be delegated to the King from the people, and may be reſumed by the people at pleaſure upon their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then the ſupremacy is abſolutely and primarily in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and but derivatively and ſecondarily in the King, and by conſequence all Government is virtually <hi>Democratical;</hi> nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every Government is properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is generally acknowledged to be the worſt kind of Government, the end and concluſion whereof all Statiſts (even the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for <hi>Polarchy</hi>) agree to be confuſion and deſolation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon is taken from the Relations which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inveſted with Regal Honour, have unto God; by virtue whereof they are ſtyled in Scripture the children of God. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 82. Miniſters and ſervants of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.6. But we have no warrant or ground either in nature, reaſon, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to priviledge the people to elect and appoint children or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties and ſervants unto God: or to conſecrate a perſon (for the perſon of the King is ſacred) And therefore the election of Kings cannot pertain unto the people. For a ſacred effect cannot proceed from a prophane cauſe.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is taken from the nature of the Kings office, which is to judge the people, for no Judge ought to receive any gift or benefit from thoſe who are to be judged by him, becauſe all engagements occaſion partiality in the judgements even of the wiſeſt men. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.19. But he that receives a Crown, receives
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114572:69"/>
a gift, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; therefore no King ought to receive his Crown from the people, nor be elected by them. Nay and for this very reaſon, <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed all the officers who were to judge the people under him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. And <hi>David,</hi> thoſe who were to judge them under him, either in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or civil affaires. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. unto the 27.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon is taken from the peoples Incapacity &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſſe to manage ſuch a prerogative manifeſted by God himſelf in three particulars: Firſt in their Ignorance, Secondly their Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, Thirdly their Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their ignorance and want of judgement to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil, and that alſo in this particular point of Government. A manifeſt whereof is exhibited in <hi>Solomon,</hi> who (though he was an Idolater, and ſo grievouſly peccant in his duty towards God, yet) doth receive an ample teſtimony from the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> of his juſtice and munificence towards his people, which was the ground of that <hi>Panagyrick</hi> pronounced by the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba</hi> concerning <hi>Solomons</hi> Government. In which particular he was alſo a Type of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the object of the <hi>Jewes</hi> expectation til this very day concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is the enjoyment of a happineſſe under his Government, Paralel to that of <hi>Solomons.</hi> Yet were not the people in the dayes of <hi>Solomon</hi> contented with his Government, but deſired an alteration; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his Tyranny and oppreſſion. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their factiouſneſſe (a conſtant effect and conſequence of their Ignorance.) For there was never any pretence againſt a preſent Government, and men in Authority, ſo abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, which did not reliſh with, and obtain ſupport from the multitude. Witneſſe the conſpiracy of <hi>Korah</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 16. Of <hi>Abſalom</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Of the High Prieſts and Rulers againſt our <hi>Saviour Chriſt. Mat.</hi> 26. Of <hi>Thoudas</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> againſt <hi>Ceſar. Acts</hi> 5. And indeed the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and horrid miſchiefes which enſued upon the peoples tumultes about the election of their <hi>Biſhops</hi> (which in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative times was (for ſome reaſons) permitted to the people) were the very cauſe for which the <hi>Emperour</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Juſtinian</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted that priviledge from the people to the Prieſts, &amp; ſome few of the Citizens; (which afterwards for the like (and ſome other)

               <p n="3">3. Their inconſtancie; (an inſeparable effect and conſequence of the two former) For God himſelf could never pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple long with any of his bleſſings, though he gave them bread from Heaven, yet their ſoules ſoon loathed it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.6. Though the <hi>Lord</hi> appointed the weakeſt man upon the earth for their Ruler and Judge, yet they complained of his Tyranny. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3. And you ſee what great joy they expreſſed upon the deſertion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the exaltation of the golden Calf, which <note n="f." place="margin">Loc. Com. Claſſ. <hi>4.</hi> Ca. <hi>20.</hi>

                  <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> makes the ground of his reſult concerning the Illegality and Injuſtice of the placing ſuch a Power in the people in the collation and arbitrary reaſſumption of this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamacy. For ſaith he, <hi>If any ſuch Power were in the people, the moſt juſt and gratious Kings could not be ſafe; For though they Rule never ſo well, yet they ſhall never long ſatisfie the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to compleat the confutation of this opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the peoples right unto and power in this Royal inveſtiture, I ſhal return an anſwer to the Arguments alledged for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation thereof, and to thoſe damnable and execrable Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces grounded thereupon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To theſe Inſtances of Scripture mentioning the peoples
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114572:70"/>
making and anointing of Kings, I anſwer, that theſe acts of the people were performed two wayes, 1. Sometimes as acts of homage and duty, by way of acknowledgement and teſtification of the Supreamacy already Legally confirmed upon the perſon to whom theſe dutyes are performed. And ſuch acts are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon two ſeveral occaſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where God did conferre this Supreamacy and Regal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by any extraordinary wayes and means, as in <hi>Saul, David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> 2 Where God uſed their meanes for the Vindication of the Kings juſt Title againſt an uſurper. As in <hi>Joas,</hi> whom <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, and the Captaines and people crowned and anointed King in the Temple; reſtoring him to his juſt Rights which had been uſurped by his Grand-Mother <hi>Athaliah.</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.12.13. And in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſtored to his juſt Power, which the conſpirators (who flew his Father) had uſurped: And in both theſe caſes the acts of the people are good and lawful, and approved by God; being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the wil of God, upon the former occaſion extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, upon the latter, ordinarily.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe acts of the people are ſometimes acts of power and Authority, collating this Supreamacy and Regal power upon ſome perſon, who hath no other right or Title thereunto; neither of Birth-right, nor of Revelation from God: As upon <hi>Abſalom, Adonijah, Jehoahaz, Judas, Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Barchozba</hi> (who profeſſed himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and drew the people into rebellion againſt the <hi>Romane Emperor,</hi> which occaſioned thoſe warres wherein <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> were deſtroyed.) And theſe acts of the people are ſinful and rebellious, and ſo declared by Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereupon: For whereſoever the Scriptures mention the conſtitution of a King after this manner, you ſhal find that they likewiſe record (not onely the fruſtrations of the peoples endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but alſo) that they were fruſtrated by ſome heavy and ſuddaine judgements from God, both upon the uſurper (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was degraded from his undue honour) and the people who preſumed to conferre that honour upon him without a warrant from God, and ſo by that meanes to obtrude a deputy upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114572:70"/>
God of their own, and not of Gods election.</p>
               <p>And you may further obſerve for ſatiſfaction in this point, that theſe acts of the peoples in a King, and anointing of Kings are onely mentioned where ſome of theſe occaſions happened, (that is, where there was an Interruption of the ordinary meanes of conferring this Supreamacy by Birth-right and Hereditary ſucceſſion; either by the Interpoſition of Gods juſt Prerogative in the advancement of ſome perſon by extraordinary and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation, or elſe by the uſurpation of ſome who had no right or Title at all, but force and violence, (either private of themſelves and ſome few partners, wherein God ſtirred up the people to Vindicate the Kings Right, or publique of the people) but where the Supreamacy and Soveraign Power, (with all the appendages) deſcended by Birth-right, there is no mention at all made of the people, though the acts of duty and homage was as neceſſary to be performed to ſuch Kings, and were alſo actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed to all who enjoyed the Crown by Hereditary ſucceſſion, (as <hi>Abijah, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Iehoram</hi> and the reſt, to whom the people were no leſſe ſubject and obedient, then to thoſe who were appointed by God) but yet I ſay in thoſe caſes, the peoples act of ſubmiſſion and homage are not expreſſed but preſuppoſed as known acts of duty to thoſe Kings who attained the Supreamacy by thoſe ordinary and known meanes, of Birth-right and Hereditary ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the reaſon alledged for the peoples Right to this Royal Inveſtiture. I anſwer, that the honour and ſubmiſſion which the people exhibit to their King, are not acts of favour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and diſpoſed voluntarily at their own will and pleaſure, but acts of duty whereunto they are obliged by the Law of God. And therefore muſt be performed to ſuch as God eſteems wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the honour to be his Deputies; and not upon ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves judge worthy to be their Ruler. For as it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that God ſhould require our conſent to make us, ſo neither is it neceſſary that he ſhould require our conſent to govern us. For though the <hi>Angels</hi> be Inveſted with a Supreamacy over men, and men over natural Agents, yet neither did the natural Agents
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114572:71"/>
elect or conſtitute men their Lords and ſuperiors, nor men the <hi>Angels.</hi> And therefore that God who did conſtitute and ordain theſe degrees of ſuperiority and ſubordination amongſt the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Univerſe without their conſent, may by the ſame right and juſtice conſtitute the like degrees of diſtinction amongſt the particulars of any ſpecies, without any concurrent Act of theirs. For you know the people are obliged to exhibit acts of honour and reverence to the Judge, but it doth not therefore follow, that the people make that man a Judge, but he is made ſuch by letters Patents from the King, without asking any conſent from the people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To S. <hi>Peters</hi> teſtimony, I anſwer, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there doth relate partly unto the ſubject of ſoveraignty, &amp; that is the King, who in his natural capacity is properly a man, and patrly to the object of Royal power, which is the people, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom that power is exerciſed. In both which reſpects it may be properly termed an ordinance of man; But it doth not at all relate unto the Originall and Efficient cauſe of that power, which is God himſelf, and neither King nor people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To that former inference, that though the King be <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> yet he is <hi>minor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis.</hi> I anſwer, that it is a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1. Abſurd and ridiculous in <hi>nature.</hi> 2. Senceleſſe and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in <hi>Policy.</hi> 3. Groundleſſe and damnable in <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Nature,</hi> for a Kings Power muſt needs be the ſame with a Fathers in ſubſtance, (onely the Kings is more abſolute and more obligatory, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) both being grounded upon the ſame precept, and expreſt in the ſame words: And can any believe, that, if a Father have thirteen ſons, ſeven of thoſe mayby joynt conſent renounce their Father, and depoſe him from all Authority; either over themſelves or their other ſix bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſeize his eſtate, and lock him up in a cloſe rooms. I believe if the obſervator, the Author of this Corollarie ſhould be ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his own ſonnes, he would not commend them for dutyful children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Policy,</hi> It is ſenceleſse and deſtructive. For if the Major part of the people be ſuperior to the King, then the Government
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114572:71"/>
is not <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> but <hi>Democraticall;</hi> and that alſo a Democracy of the baſeſt ſort. For every ſpecies of Policy, derives its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and nature from thoſe who are Inveſted with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preamacy. And that confuſion and deſtruction is alwayes the concluſion of ſuch a Government, both experience, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent of Polititians, doth declare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In <hi>Divinity,</hi> It is groundleſs and damnable, being directly contrary to that expreſs Rule which God himſelf hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this caſe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evill, nor ſpeak in a cauſe to decline after many.</hi> Where God plainly declares that the univerſality of the offenders cannot legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the fault; as appeares alſo in the ſinne of erecting the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf, <hi>Abſaloms</hi> conſpiracy, and the forecited Inſtances. For though it be a <hi>maxime</hi> in Policy, that <hi>multitudo pecca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. To return a direct anſwer to the ſecond Corollary we muſt diſtinguiſh the parts of that ſtipulation or Covenant which are three, viz: <hi>Materia, Finis, &amp; Forma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of the Covenant is two-fold. 1. <hi>Ex qua,</hi> and that is the Lawes and Rules of juſtice: 2. <hi>Circa quam,</hi> and that is the people who are the objects of al Acts of juſtice grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Lawes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end of that Covenant is two-fold. 1. <hi>Principalis,</hi> which is either <hi>primus,</hi> and that is Gods glory; or <hi>à primo-ortus,</hi> and that is the Kings honour; who is Gods Deputy. 2. <hi>minus prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalis,</hi> and that is <hi>ſalus populi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The form of the Covenant, which is the obligatory part, and (as they truly alledged) implyeth a mutual engagement of the parties therein concerned. Now the parties Primarily and Originally concerned in this Covenant are two, <hi>viz:</hi> God upon the one party, and the people upon the other party; as <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:114572:72"/>
declareth when he reciteth that Original and general Covenant, (which is indeed the ground of all other particular Covenants) <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> maketh this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a ground why people ſhould obey the Kings Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not as the Kings, but as Gods Commandment, which he termeth the oath; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. is not ſo much between the King and people, as between God and the people; For the King is onely the Deputative party (aſſigned by God, and entruſted by him for the performance of this Covenant upon Gods part.) And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> doth make the King gracious or Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical to the people according to their own deſerts, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this Covenant upon their own part: as <hi>Solomon</hi> declares, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The Kings heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water, he turns it which way ſoever he will. viz:</hi> either for a vengeance or recompence to the people, as the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf judgeth of their merits. And though the King may ſpare the wicked, and perſecute the Righteous even unto death, as <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> did our <hi>Saviour,</hi> yet even in that the King doth but execute Gods decrees, as the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> declareth concerning that unjuſt judgement of <hi>Pilates, Acts</hi> 4.28. For <hi>Pilate did nothing but what God had determined before to be donne.</hi> And therefore when the King paſſeth a judgement which we imagine to be unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we muſt not look upon the Kings judgement, and conſider that it commeth from him, and ſtill refrain both our mouths and hearts from <hi>curſing the King. Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. For when the King doth that which by the publique law is not warrantable and juſt, he is not therein unjuſt to us, but to himſelf; For though he do not obſerve the Rule which God hath ſet for him to judge by, (and therefore muſt account to God for the breach of the truſt received from him) yet he cannot tranſgreſſe the Rule of Gods Eternal Decrees which God hath appointed us to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by; According to which Law, God (by the Kings mouth and ſentence) doth puniſh even our moſt ſecret ſinnes: For <hi>every mans judgement is from the Lord,</hi> and not from the Judge or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.26. So that in a word the King may do <hi>male,</hi> (that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s a wrong to himſelf, for which he is accomptable to God;)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114572:72"/>
but he cannot do <hi>malum,</hi> that is, any wrong to us, by inflicting any thing upon us, which is not juſt, and according to our deſerts from God; whoſe place the King ſupplyes in judgement, which is the ground of <hi>Solomons</hi> aſſertion, that <hi>The Kings lips do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Divine ſentences, and that his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgement. Prov.</hi> 16.10. Now therefore upon theſe grounds of <hi>Solomons,</hi> it is manifeſt, that there is no ſenſe, why the people ſhould claim any power over the King by vertue of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 1. Becauſe he is not their Deputy but Gods, and every man muſt account to him for his actions, who doth conſtitute and depute him; As when the King doth depute a Judge for any Province or City, the people under his command have no power to queſtion him for any act which they conceive unjuſt, but either by petition to that Judge, or elſe by their addreſſes to the King his Maſter, whoſe truſt all corrupt Judges do deceive, and not the truſt of the people; For they never received any Power or Authority from the people, but from the King: And in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the people for redreſſe of their grievances from the kings op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, muſt addreſs themſelves to the King by petition, and if that prevail not, then to God by prayer, (who is the Kings <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> and from whom he receives his power, and whoſe truſt he breaks by acts of injuſtice) which is <hi>ultimum Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> declares when he propheſieth of <hi>Sauls</hi> Tyranny, whereby the people ſhould be grievouſly oppreſsed, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet foreſheweth, for redreſs whereof the people (when the King would not hear them) ſhould cry unto the <hi>Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.18. Other meanes of remedy then which the prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> did not dream of, nor could not preſcribe to the people to make uſe of, and whereas if he had conceived reſiſtance to be lawful, he might ſoon have found out that way, and have adviſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo to provide for their own ſecurity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the people never received injuſtice from the King if they look upon themſelves, for the judgement is the <hi>Lords</hi> who cannot do injuſtice, nor break the Covenant upon his part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the miniſter or Deputy may fail and offend in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his office in his own particular, which is his own guilt.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114572:73"/>
As a Hangman that executes the juſt ſentence of death upon a malefactor, if in doing his office his intentions have not reference to the ſentence of juſtice, but the ſatisfaction of ſome private grudge, or ſome covetous deſign or the like; that officer is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of murder, although the Malefactor receive from his hands nothing but his due deſerts.</p>
               <p>And thus much I hope may be ſufficient to declare the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and vanity of that opinion that the peoples conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation are the ordinary and Inſtrumental meanes and cauſes of that ſupremacy and Soveraign power, which doth prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence the <hi>Monarch</hi> above all others within the ſame ſociety, and from whence he derives his title to the Regal Diademe.

Where you ſhall finde this Curſe placed in the fift and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of Gods judgements. And in <hi>Eſay</hi> 10.5. the <hi>Lord</hi> ſtyled the victorious King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> the rod of his Wrath, and ſtaffe of his Indignation; becauſe by his ſword he was reſolved to pour out the Vials of his fierce Wrath upon the ten tribes for their Idolatries and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
               <p>Quaere. <hi>It may be here demanded, Whether Conqueſt be a lawfull and good Title, and Whether any King who doth claime from thence be a lawfull King, or onely an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Conqueſt in it ſelf makes no better Title to a Crown, then <hi>Ahab</hi> had to <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, or then the Robber hath to the travellers purſe. For as it is an affliction and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the paſſive party, ſo it is a ſinne and injuſtice in the active party; and directly contrary to the Law of God which prohibits all injuries to our neighbours. But yet ſuch a Title may be Legitimated and made lawfull by the declaration of Gods will (which is the ground of all Law) concerning the ſame. Now Gods will in this caſe is declared two wayes. 1. Extraordinarily by Immediate Revelation. And ſo <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's,</hi> and <hi>Jehu's,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchad-nezzer's</hi> Titles were Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114572:75"/>
2. Ordinarily, by the extinguiſhment of the Iſſue Royall, which is a declaration of his wrath and vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that family; And ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> did Legitimate <hi>Baaſha's</hi> Title, as himſelf acknowledgeth, by the exſtinguiſhment of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> houſe. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. and <hi>Cha.</hi> 16.2. Now where the <hi>Lord</hi> hath declared his will by either of theſe wayes, the Conquerers Title is good and Legal; and all thoſe who claim from that Conqueror, are good and lawful Kings. But where the Conquerors Title is not Legitimated by one of theſe two wayes, the Conquerer is but a meer uſurper, and it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull, but a neceſſary duty in the people to reſiſt him, and to uſe their utmoſt endeavours for the depoſition of that uſurper, and the reſtitution of their Lawful Soveraign to his juſt Rights, as <hi>Jehojada</hi> and the people reſtored <hi>Jehoaſh,</hi> by the depoſition and murder of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> after ſhe had reigned peaceably for ſix yeares. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. And as the people reſtored <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> by the depoſition of thoſe Conſpirators who ſlew his Father <hi>Amaziah,</hi> after they had reigned peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably eleven yeares. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. Chriſt</hi> was the true heire to the Crown of <hi>Judah,</hi> as is ſufficiently proved both <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.37. Yet he both taught and acted obedience to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who was but a Conquerer, and therefore the Conquerers Title may be good, and our ſubjection due to him, though the Royal Iſſue be not extinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Chriſt</hi> himſelf anſwereth this objection, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.36. denying his Kingdome to be of this world, meaning the actual adminiſtration of an earthly Kingdome; For though his Title was juſt and good to ſuch a Kingdome, yet he, to expreſs his humility and contempt of all worldly pomp, for a pattern to his Diſciples, would not ſeek nor endeavour the attainment of that honour, although if he had endeavoured the ſame, yet it had been no rebellion in him, for if he would have clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, his ſervants would and might lawfully have fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies, but the reaſon why they did not, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> did deny them a commiſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11. But
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114572:75"/>
for the juſtneſs and Legality of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Title to the Crown of <hi>Judah</hi> (Notwithſtanding <hi>Ceſars</hi> title of Conqueſt) all thoſe places cited out of <hi>Matthew, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare it. And therefore ſeeing <hi>Ceſars</hi> conqueſt of that Kingdome, could not ſo, Legitimate his Title, as to deſtroy <hi>Chriſts</hi> Right to the Crown; I do thence conclude that Conqueſt is not a lawful Title in it ſelf, nor a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant for us to withdraw our obedience from our lawful and native Soveraign, before God hath declared his wil and pleaſure concerning the ſame by one of the two prementioned wayes, unleſs, where it pleaſeth the Prince himſelf to ſubmit, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and then our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that Conquerer, is a part of our duty to our own Prince, and an act of obedience Primarily to his Commands, and by vertue of the Princes Commands to the Conquered. For it is our duty to honour them whom the King will honour.</p>
               <p>Quaere <hi>If it be not lawfull for the people to elect their own King, nor any other meanes aſſigned by God for collation of this honour, but either Birth-right or Conqueſt; What is to be done where the Royall Iſſue is extinct, and no Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth Claime? Or elſe where a mixt multitude (amongſt whome there is no relation of blood to preheminence one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt) do conſent to make a Plantation, and to erect a new Common-wealth?</hi>

                  <hi>Sol. Samuel</hi> hath ſet us a preſident in this Caſe. 1 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 10.20.21. For though the <hi>Lord</hi> had revealed his will to <hi>Samuel</hi> concerning his owne election and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Saul</hi> to be King. 1 <hi>Samuel,</hi> 9.15. Yet becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> knew that King ſhould be a Tyrant to plague the people for their Idolatrous truſt in a King, 1 <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> 10.18. he concealed that Revelation, and would not nominate their King, leaſt the people ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (when they ſuffered by <hi>Sauls</hi> oppreſſion) blame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114572:76"/>
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> for appointing him: But uſed the meanes of <hi>lots</hi> to declare the will and pleaſure of God unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And the like courſe was uſed by the eleven <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> when they had no warrant from God to appoint or elect another <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> nor durſt preſume to conferre that high calling upon any man without a warrant from God, as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>So that in both thoſe caſes mentioned in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we are to uſe the meanes of <hi>lots;</hi> For that meanes is likewiſe warranted by God, where his will is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declared. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 16.33. But the peoples election is abſolutely unlawful (as the premiſes (I hope) have ſufficiently manifeſted) either in thoſe or any other caſes.</p>
               <p>And thus much of <hi>Monarchie</hi> in its <hi>Natural acception,</hi> as it relates to that ſupremacy, which doth Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence the <hi>Monarch</hi> above all the reſt of the ſociety; and thereby entitle him to the Crown.

And this power was all the title which Chriſt had to that Aſſes-Colt, which he ſent his Diſciples to fetch for his uſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.30. for it appeares, in the Text, that Chriſt was not the proprietour of that colt, yet he did not give order to his Diſciples, either to buy, or hire, or begge, or borrow the colt of the owners; but onely to tell any that profered to interrupt them, that the Lord had need of him: for it was a ſufficient title to diſpoſſeſſe the private ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the publike Lord of all did command him; and upon that anſwer, the private owner did not reſiſt the Diſciples in taking him away, <hi>Ver.</hi> 34.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114572:81"/>
all the Corne of Egypt for ſeven yeares together; which law was enacted by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon the ſingle Counſell of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> with the approbation onely of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> ſervants or Councell, and not by the generall conſent of the people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.34. Neither can we pretend this law to be Tyrannicall, amd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of God and Nature; for it proceeded from the wiſdome of God, which in this buſineſſe directed the mind of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 45.57. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. Nor can any man imagine, but the ſtate and magnificence of <hi>Saul, David, Jeroboam,</hi> and others, who of private perſons, were advanced by God himſelf to Regall honour and dignity, was ſupported by this meanes of Cuſtome and Tribute, (for their owne private patrimonies could not be ſufficient for maintaining ſuch Kingly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence) nor doe we finde any particular Law or Statute for the particular endowment of theſe Kings, but onely that generall Right and Prerogative which they derive from God, inveſting them with a power over both our eſtates and perſons: which was the cauſe that God preſcribed not in the Law any ſettled or certaine maintenance for Kings, as he did for Prieſts. For though both were his anointed Servants and Deputies, (and Kings alſo in a higher degree, for they had power over the Prieſts as well as the people; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was not onely a god to the people, but to <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 4. And <hi>Moſes, David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and other godly Kings exerciſed this power over both Prieſts and Levites; yea, even over the high Prieſts themſelves, and that in the higheſt manner, depoſing one and advancing another to that Pontificall honour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.26.) Yet in regard Kings had power to provide for themſelves in that manner as themſelves judged requiſite, for their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the peoples ſafety; whereas the Prieſts had no power at all in any ſecular matters, but what the King did delegate unto them by Commiſſion; therefore it pleaſed God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a ſet portion for the Prieſts maintenance, and not for the Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> The Lord blamed the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> for impoſing taxes upon the people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.8, 9. And when <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribed the Kings duty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. he prohibited the multiplication of horſes, and of gold and ſilver, whereby to ſpoile and oppreſſe the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:114572:81"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Lord both in theſe and many other places prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth the impoſition of all Illegall taxes and exactions, ſuch as Tyrannicall and wicked Kings uſually laid upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the ſupport of their owne inſatiate luſts and vanities; and ſuch as <hi>Samuel</hi> told the Iſraelites would be impoſed upon them by <hi>Saul,</hi> in his Tyrannicall government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10. But never prohibited ſuch as were intended for the honour of himſelfe and the King, and the benefit and welfare of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though they ſeemed never ſo heavy and grievous, (as that tax was which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by <hi>Joſeph's</hi> adviſe impoſed upon the Egyptians for ſeven yeares together) which uſe and end is not to be determined by the people's diſcretion, but the Kings; as appeares in that inſtance concerning <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> act. And therefore though it be unlawfull for the King to demand ſuch taxes, for any other intent but the honour of himſelfe, and the good of his Subjects; yet is it not lawfull for the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, or reſiſt the Kings authority, when they ſuppoſe and judge them to be demanded for other wicked ends: as appeares by thoſe addreſſes which <hi>Samuel</hi> told the people they ſhould make unto the Lord for redreſſe of <hi>Sauls</hi> Tyranny, by prayers and teares, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.18. For neither <hi>Samuel</hi> nor the people in thoſe dayes dreamed of theſe means of reſiſtance and dethrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kings, which the Devill hath ſince ſuggeſted unto his diſciples. For ſurely had thoſe ancient Statiſts underſtood theſe new redreſſes of Tyranny to be juſt and lawfull, they would never have enſlaved and ſubjected themſelves unto ſuch preſſures, as are recorded in that Text.</p>

                  <hi>Repl. Naboth</hi> did juſtly deny his vineyard unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.3. and therefore the peoples diſobedience to the Kings unjuſt demands of any part of their eſtate is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but commendable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> That deniall of <hi>Naboth's</hi> was grounded upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular law of Gods concerning Inheritances in Iſrael, as <hi>Naboth</hi> there declareth: <hi>God forbid,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Naboth) that I ſhould give the Inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</hi> For God had prohibited by his Law that any man ſhould alienate the hereditary poſſeſſions of his family, which by his appoitntment were to be reſerved entire, to continue the diſtinction of the families in Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:114572:82"/>And againe, <hi>Ahab</hi> did not command that vineyard from <hi>Naboth</hi> as a King, but as a private purchaſer, intreated <hi>Naboth</hi> to exchange or ſell it to him for a private conveniency, and not for any publike uſe: in which caſe, <hi>Naboth</hi> might juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. For though a King be alwayes a King, yet he doth not alwayes act as a King in his Politicke capacity, but ſometimes as a private perſon in his naturall capacity; as in the ſcholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcuſſion of any point in queſtion, or in any contentious recreations; as in Wraſtling, or Tennis, and the like: in which caſes it is not unlawfull to oppoſe the King, both in words and actions. And of this nature alſo are ſuch private bargaines for private uſes and conveniencies, as <hi>Ahab</hi> deſired to make with <hi>Naboth,</hi> and as <hi>David</hi> did make with <hi>Araunah</hi> for his threſhing-floore, which he would not take by his power, but bought with his monie, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. becauſe it was to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie God for his owne private offence, and not for the peoples, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. (For though the people were puniſhed, it was <hi>David</hi> alone that offended. <hi>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi.</hi>) But in whatſoever the King acts in his Politicke capacity as a King, he may not be reſiſted or oppoſed, either in words or actions, or denied any ſervice, either from our eſtates or perſons: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that capacity he is a God over us, and may claime the ſame obedience from us, which is due to God himſelfe, in all Politicall matters whereunto his Commiſſion doth extend, (as the eleventh Chapter of this Booke ſhall more fully manifeſt.) So that if <hi>Ahab</hi> had demanded this vineyard of <hi>Naboth</hi> for any publicke uſe concerning the Kings honour, and the peoples ſafety; <hi>Naboth's</hi> pretence of Inheritance could not have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and juſtified his deniall thereof to <hi>Ahab.</hi> (For inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances might be ſold in Iſrael till the year of Jubilee, in caſe of private neceſſity, as appeares. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.25. and therefore much more might be commanded by the King, in caſe of publike neceſſity: For a publicke neceſſity muſt needs be a ſtronger <hi>ſuper ſede as</hi> for any Law, then a private can be. As alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Sauls</hi> Government by <hi>Samuel</hi> doth further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10. for what that Tyrant did to ſatisfie his luſts, a good King may do to preſerve the publike.) And it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the pretence of ſuch a deniall, was the blaſphemy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114572:82"/>
whereof <hi>Jezabell</hi> cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> to be falſly accuſed; for the Text doth not ſay, that it was blaſphemy immediately againſt God but againſt God and the King; which argueth, that thoſe witneſſes accuſed <hi>Naboth</hi> of ſome diſloyall ſpeeches not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the duty of a Subject: which for ought appeares in the Text, might relate to <hi>Naboth's</hi> deniall of that vineyard, which the falſe witneſſes might pretend to have beene deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſuch uſes, and in ſuch a manner as that the deniall thereof might render <hi>Naboth</hi> guilty of a capitall diſhonour and diſobedience to the King.</p>

of King or Subjects, both which are vers't about the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and matter, onely in a diverſe manner. For the King by reaſon of the Supremacy of his power and authority, is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted onely in the active part of Government, and therefore he acts for his owne honour and the peoples welfare, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Lawes and Statutes, wherein he commands things ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſervation of peace and unity in that ſociety, (a principall ground of both the former ends.)

I purpoſe to inſiſt upon in this Chapter, which I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, was not the meaneſt inducement that gave life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this preſent diſcourſe of Monarchy; the Solution whereof, I ſuppoſe will preſent the Reader with a glimpſe of ſome of thoſe nationall crimes, which have drawne upon us theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall calamities, (a ſubject fitter for an entire Tract, then a particular Chapter;) But my deſigne at preſent is rather to ſtart then ſtate this Queſtion, hoping a more learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pen may ſupply the defects of mine, by a more punctuall and ſatisfactorie diſcuſſion and determination of this point, ſo profoundly myſterious both in Divinity and Policy.</p>
               <p>Quaere. <hi>What matters are within the ſphere of Politicall Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and what are</hi> res extra-regales, <hi>and metapoliticall matters wherein the King cannot exerciſe either his Legiſlative or Judiciarie power, without guilt of ſacrilegious intruſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This Quaere conſiſts of two parts; the latter conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiall of the former, and both of them immediate expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to enunciate the quality and extent of the Kings Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God; the ſole ground both of the Kings Power and the Subjects Obedience. For though Kings be ſtiled Gods in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. and are indeed really ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> in their Politicke capacity, referring to their power over their Subjects: yet wee all know that they are not ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> in their phyſicall capacity, referring to their nature and eſſence, for they <hi>ſhall dye like men, Pſal.</hi> 82.7. And therefore the right underſtanding of the nature of the Kings Commiſſion, and Deputation from God, I conceive to be a point of neceſſary concernment. 1. For Subjects, that they may more perfectly underſtand the juſt extent of this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in what things God hath thereby delegated a Power unto Kings over Subjects, for direction of their duty, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e. reddendi (aeſari, quae ſunt Caeſaris.</hi> 2. For Kings more eſpecially, that they may truely underſtand the due limitation of this Commiſſion, and in what things God hath reſerved the power entire to himſelfe; and to conſcience, (his higheſt and moſt immediate deputy and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute) for direction of the Kings duty, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e. reddendi Deo quae ſunt Dei.</hi> For as it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114572:84"/>
in Subjects, to intrude upon the ſacred Rights and Prerogatives of Kings, and to act in any thing as Judges or Commanders, without Commiſſion from him; ſo is it much more ſacrilegious in Kings, to intrude upon the more ſacred Rights and Prerogatives of God: and to act as Gods, Lords, and Maſters over their Subjects, in thoſe matters whereunto their Commiſſion from God doth not extend, nor inveſt them with a right of power and dominion over their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Now to give a direct anſwer to this Quaere, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to premiſe ſome diſtinctions concerning the object of Politicall Cognizance, which is two-fold: viz. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum per ſe, &amp; Objectum per accidens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Objectum per ſe,</hi> which is the direct and immediate Object of Politicall Cognizance, conſiſts in the <hi>Fundamentals and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials</hi> of Politick Government; being ſuch cauſes and matters wherein the King may lawfully exerciſe both his Legiſlative and Judiciarie power over all perſons within his Dominions, both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Objectum per accidens,</hi> which is the indirect and accidentall Object of Political Cognizance, conſiſts in the <hi>Contingentials</hi> of Politique Government, being ſuch cauſes and matters, wherein the King may lawfully exerciſe both his Legiſlative and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciarie power over ſome perſons of both ſorts, whether Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall or Civill: but not over ſome of either ſort, although they be his native Subjects, inhabiting within his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>The diſcuſſion of which two points, manifeſting what doth fall directly, and what <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> within the ſphere of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Cognizance, will be a full and direct Solution of the former part of this Quaere: from whence it will be eaſie to conclude, what are <hi>extra-regalia,</hi> and Metapoliticall matters. The judgement whereof, God hath reſerved immediately to himſelfe, and conſcience, (his immediate Deputy and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in all humane affaires) and wherein the King cannot exerciſe, either his Legiſlative, or Judiciarie power, without guilt of ſacrilegious intruſion; which will be a direct and full anſwer to the latter part of this Quaere.</p>
               <p>The point which our method preſents unto our ſcrutiny, in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114572:85"/>
the firſt place, is the <hi>Objectum per ſe</hi> of Politicall Cognizance; which (as we ſaid) conſiſts in the Eſſentials and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Politick Government: which are twofold; viz. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva, &amp; Praeternativa.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Native Fundamentals and Eſſentials</hi> of Politick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are ſuch cauſes and matters as were of Political Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnizance upon the firſt originall Inſtitution of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when mans innate knowledge, and native light of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, was ſufficient for the direction of his duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of poſitive Lawes and Statutes; and the native rectitude and inclination of mans will, was ſufficient to excite the performance of his duty, without the help of any Judiciarie inducements, either Compenſatorie, or Vindicative. But for the more full, and facile inveſtigation, and diſcovery of theſe Fundamentals and Eſſentials; theſe two expedients are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible. 1. The conſideration of the time when. 2. Of the grounds whereupon Politick Government was firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The time when</hi> Politick Government was firſt inſtituted, was immediately upon mans firſt creation in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and under the old Covenant of Workes: for Politick Government, (as we formerly manifeſted) is a naturall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, enabling man for the due performance of his naturall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and grounded upon the fifth Commandement of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law; preſcribing honour to Parents, which commenced upon mans firſt creation, before <hi>Adams</hi> Apoſtaſie: by virtue of which law of Nature, the Herauldrie of <hi>Sub &amp; Supra</hi> did then receive a being amongſt men; and Parents by virtue of that naturall law, were inveſted with a power and dominion over their Children; and Children obliged unto the duties of ſubjection and obedience to their Parents: So that though <hi>Adams</hi> ſinfull prevarication had never deveſted himſelfe and his poſterity of their native Prerogatives, yet this graduall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry of <hi>Sub &amp; Supra</hi> (ſupereminencing Parents above their Children) ſhould have had its due and naturall influence upon mankind. For even Chriſt himſelfe (although totally exempted from all manner of enormous guilt, both actuall and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, yet) was not exempted from this duty of ſubjection to his parents, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:114572:85"/>Whence it is manifeſt in the firſt place, that the Native Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals and Eſſentials, are onely naturall duties, conſiſting in the right uſe of thoſe naturall bleſſings, wherewith God did inveſt man upon his firſt creation, before his Apoſtaſie, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to enable him for the exact and due performance of thoſe duties, which God required of him in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, under the old Covenant of Workes. And therefore, as the duties which God did then require of man, were partly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, partly Externall; ſo did he conferre upon man two ſorts of naturall bleſſings correſpondent unto theſe duties. 1. Internall bleſſings, which are <hi>bona animi,</hi> or the bleſſings of the ſoule. 2. Externall, which are <hi>bona corporis, &amp; fortunae;</hi> the right uſe of which two ſorts of naturall bleſſings, is the very ſumme and ſubſtance of all the naturall duties expreſſed in the Decalogue or law of Nature, which was the Rule of all humane actions before <hi>Adams</hi> Apoſtaſie.</p>
               <p>For the regulation of all Internall acts of the underſtanding and will, (which are the faculties of our ſoules) was preſcribed in the firſt and laſt precepts of that law of Nature. And the regulation of all Externall actions concerning the body, and thoſe naturall creatures which God made for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof, was preſcribed in the other eight. And other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then theſe, were not at that time either knowne unto man, or required of him by God; ſo that no Politicall or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall power, could poſſibly at that time be extended to any other matters, but onely theſe naturall duties preſcribed in the Decalogue.</p>
               <p>A further reſtriction alſo of which power is preſcribed in the ſecond expedient, conducing to the Inveſtigation of the Native Eſſentials and Fundamentals of Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the grounds whereupon it was inſtituted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The grounds of</hi> the inſtitution of Politick Government are two: viz. <hi>Primarie, and Secondarie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Primarie ground,</hi> is the power of communicating a being and exiſtence, which indeed is the very ground whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Holy Ghoſt doth demonſtrate the Deity, and prove the Lord alone to be God, and to have the ſole right of power and dominion over man; becauſe God alone doth communicate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114572:86"/>
life, and being, and all things unto man, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is he that made us and not we our ſelves, therefore we muſt wholly devote our ſelves to his worſhip and ſervice, as his people and ſervants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2. And the reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt prohibited the exhibition of any honour or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto Idols, is, becauſe they cannot give any being unto man nor frame any man in the womb, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.24. ſo that the primarie and originall ground of Politick Government is the power to communicate a being and exiſtence; which power God delegated unto man immediately upon his firſt creation, by that propagatorie benediction, <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini, Gen.</hi> 1.28. From which fountaine did flow the other ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie and immediate ground of Politick Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Secondarie ground</hi> is the graduall and diſtinctive He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry of <hi>Sub &amp; Supra</hi> (above mentioned,) ſupereminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one man above another: For as God did ordaine parents to be his inſtruments in the communication of a being unto their children, ſo did he likewiſe ordaine, that children ſhould be ſo farre forth ſubject and inferiour unto their parents, from whom they doe derive their being, as they doe depend upon their parents for the ſame. For whereas God himſelfe by way of creation did communicate unto <hi>Adam</hi> the entire being both of ſoule and body, (in both which reſpects, <hi>Adam</hi> is ſtiled the ſonne of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. laſt;) ſo did he thereupon ordaine, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſubject and obedient unto himſelfe, in all the actions and motions both of ſoule and body: and whereas God did ordaine <hi>Adam</hi> and all his deſcendents to be Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, (by virtue of that propagatorie benediction) in the communication of the corporeall part of being unto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo did God likewiſe ordain the ſubjection and obedience of children unto their parents, to be extended unto all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall actions and motions of the body; (God reſerving ſtill the power and command over the intrinſecall acts of the ſoule of every man entire to himſelfe, becauſe every ſoule doth ſtill derive its being immediately from God, and not from our parents.)</p>
               <p>Whence it is manifeſt in the ſecond place, that thoſe Native Fundamentals and Eſſentials (which are the proper and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114572:86"/>
Object of Politicall Cognizance,) are only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall duties of the Morall law, conſiſting in the right uſe of the Externall bleſſings of nature: viz. <hi>bona corporis, &amp; fortunae,</hi> which are the onely bleſſings hereditarily deſcendable, and communicable unto children from their parents. For ſeeing all Politick Government is grounded upon paternall, (as a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy is upon an Oeconomie, which are not eſſentially, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtantially different, (both of them regulating the ſame duties and actions, onely whereas an Oeconomy doth regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the actions of one family, a Policy doth regulate the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many families.) And ſeeing all paternall Government is grounded upon this Herauldry of <hi>Sub &amp; Supra,</hi> eſtabliſhed betweene Parents and Children by the fifth Commandement; and this graduall and diſtinctive Herauldry upon the power to communicate a being and exiſtence, delegated unto parents by Gods propagatory benediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1 28. which benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reacheth onely the corporall, and not the ſpirituall part of man: It doth neceſſarily follow, that no Politicall or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall power can be directly extended to any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but onely the corporeall and externall duties of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> If the communication of a being and exiſtence were the ground of this Herauldry of <hi>Sub &amp; Supra,</hi> then all children ſhould be ſubject and inferiour unto their parents; but <hi>Aſa</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> was not ſubject to his grandmother <hi>Maacha,</hi> but did depoſe her, and yet was not reproved but commended for that act, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. And ſo was <hi>Joaſh</hi> for the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Athaliah</hi> his fathers mother, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the communication of a being cannot be the primarie ground, either of that ſubordination, or of the inſtitution of Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> All men as men, and in their naturall capacity, are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and ought to be ſubject unto their parents; but men as Kings, and in their Politick capacity, cannot be children unto any man, nor have any father but God; and therefore are ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Holy Ghoſt, the children of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are children of the most high,</hi> and therefore in this ſenſe they cannot be inferiour or ſubject unto any but God alone,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114572:87"/>
and ſo by conſequence muſt be above their owne naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in Rule, Dominion, and Power: and in caſe of juſtice, muſt not reſpect that naturall relation, no more then <hi>Aſa</hi> did reſpect it in his grandmother <hi>Maacha,</hi> who in this Politick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was not a Parent or Judge, but a ſubject and child to her owne naturall grandchild; and ſo was <hi>Athaliah</hi> to <hi>Joaſh.</hi> And the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to her ſonne Chriſt Jeſus, who rebuked his own mother when ſhe preſumed to command in matters above her ſphere, for a miraculous ſupply of the defect of wine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2 <hi>Woman what have I to do with thee?</hi> He doth not here give her the ſtile of Mother, but of Woman; as if ſhe had no relation of a parent and governour to him: becauſe that command or deſire which ſhe tranſmitted to him, could not be performed by him, as he was a man, and her naturall ſonne, but onely as he was a God, and ſo a ſpirituall father to his owne naturall mother.</p>
               <p>And thus much briefly of the Native Fundamentals and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of Politick Government; the next point to be ſpoken of is the Preternative.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Preternative Fundamentals and Eſſentials</hi> of Politick Government, are thoſe matters which fell directly within the ſphere of Politicall Cognizance upon the reſtitution of that Government, when that bleſſing (amongſt others which are the ground and object thereof) was renewed unto man by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in Chriſt, after <hi>Adams</hi> ſinfull prevarication had deveſted both himſelfe and his poſterity of all thoſe bleſſings wherewith God had inriched his created nature: which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of nature were not renewed unto man in their native in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and perfection, but onely in ſuch a meaſure as the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſaw moſt expedient to immind man of his owne infirmity, and ſelfe-inſufficiency: whereby to occaſion the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of himſelfe to ſeeke for happineſſe in the mercy of God in Chriſt, and not in any naturall perfections, worth, or excellency of his owne. For which purpoſe, God was pleaſed to leave the underſtanding of man <hi>in ſtatis ſuo reſtituto,</hi> ſo much obnubilated, that his naturall knowledge is not ſufficient for direction of ſuch naturall duties, as are requiſite to peace and unity, the meanes to preſerve humane ſociety, which is one of the ends of Politick Government: which defect therefore in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114572:87"/>
naturall knowledge, God ordained to be ſupplied by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Kings Legiſlative power, in the compoſure of Lawes and Statutes for mans direction, both in Eccleſiaſticall and Civill affaires. And for the ſame purpoſe, did likewiſe leave the will of man ſo much depraved, that his naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is not ſufficient to excite him to the performance of ſuch naturall duties, as are requiſite unto the preſervation, peace and unity of humane ſocieties; (though hee did know and underſtand them) but rather unto thoſe oppoſite ſins and tranſgreſſions, which tend to the diſſolution and deſtruction thereof: which defects in our naturall inclinations, God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be ſupplied by the exerciſe of a Judiciarie power, whereby to excite us to the performance of theſe naturall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, either by the remuneration of our merits of obedience, or the puniſhment of our crimes of diſobedience, unto the Lawes and Statutes, compoſed for mans direction, both in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civill affaires: ſo that the exerciſe both of the Legiſlative and Judiciarie power of Kings, were meere emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of mans Apoſtaſie. Before which time (though Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was eſtabliſhed amongſt men by that law of nature, yet) in regard that Law whereupon this Government was founded, was ſo principled in mens hearts, that it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to direct all Politicall and Monarchicall duties; and the naturall rectitude of their wills, to excite the performance of them) there was no occaſion at all for the exerciſe, either of the Legiſlative or Judiciarie power for direction of Politicall and Monarchicall duties, or reſtraint of Politicall and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall exorbitances: neither ſhould there ever have beene any more occaſion (if man had perſiſted in that his native In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and integ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y) for any ſuch direction or reſtraint, then there was to direct the duties, or reſtraine the exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſt himſelfe, (whoſe innocency and integrity, both in his nativity and converſation, was parallel to <hi>Adams</hi> in his created, and native ſtate, and condition:) the conformity of whoſe active obedience to authority <hi>in omnibus licitis,</hi> and paſſive <hi>in illicit is,</hi> neither was nor could be any way defective to the moſt exact rules and lawes of God and nature.</p>
               <p>Whence it is manifeſt, that (though Magiſtrates in the ſtate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114572:88"/>
of Innocency, were inveſted (by the law of nature) both with a Legiſlative and Judiciarie power <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> yet) the <hi>actus exercitus,</hi> or exerciſe thereof, was a meere emergency of mans prevarication and Apoſtaſie, which did not occaſion God to ordaine and inſtitute any new ſort of humane policy, or any new lawes, for direction of Politicall duties, but onely to ordaine the actuall uſe and exerciſe of his Legiſlative power, to ſupply and help the defects, imperfections, and infirmities of his underſtanding, in the lawes of nature, by the compoſure of Poſitive Lawes and Statutes: and of his Judiciary power, to correct and regulate the depravities of his will, by remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the merits of his obedience, and puniſhing the crimes of his diſobedience to thoſe Lawes and Statutes.</p>
               <p>The reſult of all which, is but briefly this, that the <hi>Objectum per ſe,</hi> or the direct and immediate Object of Politicall Cognizance, (conſiſting in the Fundamentals and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Politick Government) is onely the externall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſcribed in the Morall Law; in reference unto which duties, Kings both may and ought to exerciſe both their Legiſlative and Judiciary power, over all perſons within their Dominions, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Some do object againſt this, that Chriſt hath ſuffered for the ſins of the whole world, and therefore that no man ought to be puniſhed for ſinne; for it would be a point of direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to require ſatisfaction of us for that, for which our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath already paid, and given plenary and perfect ſatisfaction to our Creditour: ſo that the exerciſe of the vindicative part of Judiciary power in Magiſtrates, inflicting puniſhment for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, muſt needs be unlawfull, and deſtructive to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and priviledges of the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that the puniſhments inflicted by Magiſtrates, are not intended for the ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice for our offences againſt God, but for the inſtruction of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in order to the publike peace: for no temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or tortures how extremely inhumane and barbarous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can poſſibly be ſatisfactory for the leaſt ſinne againſt the law of God, whoſe merits in the court of Gods Juſtice, are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114572:88"/>
eternall death. Neither doth any man ſuffer now in earth, nor ſhall any man ſuffer hereafter in hell, for any ſinne againſt God and his law of nature, but onely for ſinnes againſt Chriſt, and his law of the Goſpell; that is, for infidelity, deſpaire, and want of charity, or the love of Chriſt, (as I have already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the Introduction.) So that the puniſhments inflicted by the Magiſtrate, is not intended for ſatisfaction of any ſinne committed againſt God, (for that ſatisfaction is peculiar to the ſufferings of Chriſt,) but for prevention of future miſchiefes, either in the offender, or others, or both, that men may live together in peace and unity, following all godlineſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, according to the commands of the Goſpell, and law of Chriſt; which, as I ſaid before, is not different from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, (given by God at the firſt creation) in Eſſence, (for both of them enjoyne the ſame duties) but onely in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance and the manner of performing theſe duties. For whereas the law of God doth require an exact and legall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, according to the letter of the law; the law of Chriſt doth require onely an equitable and Evangelicall performance, according to the meaſure of our abilities. And therefore, whereas the offences againſt Gods law were determinable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Court of Juſtice, and ſo puniſhed according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and merit of the treſpaſſe; the offences now againſt Chriſts law, are determinable onely in a Court of Mercy and Equity; and ſo puniſhed according to the meaſure of our abilities, and the miſ-imployment of ſuch talents and bleſſings as wee have received by Chriſt, (who hath renewed by his Spirit in every mans ſoule, ſome of the obliterated characters of nature, whereof they were deprived by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinfull prevarication.) And according to this law of Chriſt, are all the Nations and Kingdomes of the world now governed, as well Heathen as Chriſtian; for all Government was by his Father tranſmitted unto him, <hi>John</hi> 13.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. ſo that now all Kings and Rulers, as well Heathen as Chriſtian, are Chriſts Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Deputies, (for what <hi>Solomon</hi> attributed to Chriſts power indefinitely in the conſignation of Kings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>By me Kings raigne: David</hi> expreſly extendeth to Heathens as well as Chriſtians, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will give thee the Heathen for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114572:89"/>
thine inheritance.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> expreſly affirmeth Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>Prince of all the Kings of the earth, Apoc.</hi> 1.5.) And therefore, all Kings doe now order and decree all things in a Court of mercy and equity, which looketh upon the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the offender; and not in a Court of Juſtice, which looketh onely upon the quality of the offence: For no Prince in the world, whether Heathen or Chriſtian, doe puniſh Ideots and Mad-men for the ſame offences, which ſometimes are made capitall in men of underſtanding; the reaſon is, becauſe theſe are capable of Reformation, and to be made better by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the other not ſo; and therefore, though the offence be the ſame in both, yet the puniſhment is not ſo: whence it is manifeſt, that the exerciſe of the Kings Judiciary power, is not intended for ſatisfaction for ſinne, (for which Chriſt died) but meerely for reſtraint of ſuch enormities, as are deſtructive to peace and unity, and by conſequence, to all Politick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſpece of the Object of Politicall Cognizance, is <hi>Objectum per accidens,</hi> which is the indirect and mediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Politick Government, conſiſting in the Contingentials thereof, being ſuch cauſes and matters, wherein the King may exerciſe both his Legiſlative and Judiciarie power over ſome perſons, both Eccleſiaſticall and Civill, but not over other ſome of either ſort: And theſe are thoſe ſupernaturall and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall duties, which were never knowne nor any way uſefull upon the firſt inſtitution of Politick Government under the old Covenant of Workes; but were inſtituted afterward, and made ordinances of the new Covenant of Grace, (not directly for helps of Politick Government, but) for the immediate meanes and helps to life and ſalvation by Chriſt, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his myſticall kingdome. Such as were <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments both of the Old and New Teſtament, which were ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ordinances, inſtituted by God, meerely, as ſeales and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this new Covenant of Grace: and alſo, all Evangelicall formes of Worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline, relating immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto Chriſt.</hi> All which, are ſupernaturall duties, wherein the light of nature (though it were reſtored to its native and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine purity) is no way conducent to guide or direct us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114572:89"/>
particular revelations of the Spirit of God, declared either by Scripture, or ſome other extraordinary and ſupernaturall meanes: which duties therefore cannot be knowne to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to which God never vouchſafed the benefit of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, nor be poſſibly capable of any legall ſanctions, from the moſt prudent and intelligent Legiſlator, that ever ſate at ſterne in any Heatheniſh Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And yet though Heathens cannot be good Chriſtians, they may be good Kings, as the Holy Ghoſt teſtifieth of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whoſe Government is much magnified, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. although he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing of theſe Evangelicall duties which relate to Chriſt: the like Panegyricks are recorded (not onely by the Heatheniſh, but alſo) by Chriſtian Authors, of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Solon</hi> of <hi>Athens, Lycurgus,</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Tullius,</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this is further manifeſted by that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and rationall anſwer, which <hi>Gallio</hi> the Romane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty returned to the complaints of the <hi>Jewes</hi> againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> for preaching againſt the Jewiſh Ceremonies, and the outward form of worſhip preſcribed by <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 18.14, 15. <hi>If it were a matter of wrong or injustice,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gallio</hi>) (which importeth ſins againſt the law of the ſecond Table) <hi>or of wicked lewdneſſe,</hi> (which importeth ſinnes againſt the law of the firſt Table of the Morall law) <hi>then reaſon would (O ye Jewes) that I ſhould bear with you. But if it be a Question of your law, looke ye to it, for I will be no Judge of ſuch matters.</hi> Whence it is obſervable, that though this wiſe Heathen was perſwaded, that it was a part of his office and duty to judge of offences againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (whether they were tranſgreſſions of the firſt Table, and ſo immediately againſt God; or of the ſecond Table, and ſo immediately againſt our neighbour,) ye he did conclude from the principles of ſound reaſon, that the judgement of theſe Jewiſh Ceremonies, (which were not naturall but Evangelicall duties) did not pertaine to his Office or Calling: So that theſe Evangelicall duties cannot be directly and <hi>per ſe</hi> the Object of Politicall Cognizance, or the ſubject of any poſitive Law or Statute, generally obligatory unto all perſons.</p>
               <p>But yet theſe Evangelicall duties, may and doe fall within the ſphere of Politicall Cognizance indirectly, and <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:114572:90"/>
that is, in ſuch perſons to whom God doth vouchſafe the benefit of theſe ſupernaturall revelations; for in regard the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worſhip of God, ought to be the firſt and principall care of all Kings, as well Heathen as Chriſtian, (according to the Maxime of that <note n="*" place="margin">Ariſt. pol. lib. <hi>7</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>

               <p>Onely by the way I ſhall premiſe another briefe <hi>praecognitum</hi> to facilitate the underſtanding of theſe enſuing Corollaries;<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That (in regard the opinions of Heathens, Jewes, and Chriſtians, doe generally concenter in the due extent, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Regall power, in order to the duties of the ſecond Table,) my preſent diſcourſe ſhall onely referre unto the duties of the firſt Table of the Morall Law, for two reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the people are moſt ſubject to offend in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that two wayes:
<list>
                     <item>1. Through errour; becauſe theſe duties do moſt tranſcend their naturall reaſon.</item>
                     <item>2. Through zeale; becauſe they conceive theſe duties moſt neerly to concerne their eternall, and ſpirituall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and welfare.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Kings and Magiſtrates are, or at leaſt wiſe ought to be moſt diligent in the reformation and puniſhment of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which immediately concerne God and Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the promotion of Gods honour, worſhip, and ſervice, is the principall part of the office and calling of Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; the direction of whoſe precipitate zeale in this point, is the abſolute deſigne of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The firſt Theſis declaring what are <hi>omnimodò Regalia,</hi> is this.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theſis</hi> 1.</note> All Externall duties preſcribed in the foure laſt precepts of the firſt Table of the Morall Law, are directly and properly of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Cognizance; ſo that the King may lawfully exerciſe his Legiſlative power in the compoſure of Lawes and Statutes, for direction of honour, worſhip, and ſervice, both to God and himſelfe, and that concerning both publike and private acts of honour and worſhip, whether of the body, or of the tongue: and here the diſpoſall and ordering of our eſtates, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>bona fortunae,</hi> as well as <hi>bona corporis</hi>) muſt be preſuppoſed to be directly of the ſame cognizance, and to pertaine to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114572:92"/>
ſame power. For <hi>Solomon</hi> commands to honour the Lord with our ſubſtance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. and God ordained parents and Kings to be his inſtruments in the impartment of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings of fortune, as well as the bleſſings of the body, unto their children and ſubjects: and therefore it is lawfull for them to command in the one as well as the other, in order to all outward duties. And in whatſoever he may lawfully exerciſe his Legiſlative power, in the ſame he may likewiſe exerciſe his Judiciary; for that is the life of the Law, which without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, is but a dead letter, like a man without a ſoule.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon the confirmation of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollarie, becauſe I preſume the grounds already premiſed in the former part of this Chapter, may be ſufficient to warrant this concluſion. And beſides the profeſt deſigne of this Chapter, is not ſo much the extent as the limitation of the Kings power, in order to Evangelicall duties, which are <hi>extra-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia.</hi> and Metapoliticall matters, whereof wee ſhall ſpeake in the two following Theſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theſis</hi> 2.</note>The ſecond Theſis which declares what are <hi>partì Regalia,</hi> and <hi>partìm extra-regalia,</hi> relates to matters of Evangelicall worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline; which is this.</p>
               <p>No Evangelicall ceremonies or formes of worſhip, nor any Eccleſiaſticall Government or Diſcipline which relateth unto Chriſt, is directly, and <hi>per ſe</hi> of Politicall Cognizance, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indirectly, and <hi>per accidens.</hi> And therefore the King cannot lawfully enact any Lawes or Statutes concerning theſe matters, which ſhall be generally obligatory unto all perſons within his Dominions; but onely unto ſuch perſons whom God hath enlightned by his ſpirit, and thereby ſatisfied their conſciences of the lawfulneſſe and Religion of ſuch Worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are two.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The firſt whereof is fully declared in the former part of this Chapter, demonſtrating all Ceremonies which relate unto Chriſt, and are any wayes ſignificative, either of his perſon, his offices, or acts of mediation, to be ſupernaturall matters, and therefore ſuch, wherein the light of nature cannot be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient guide, ſo that they cannot be ranged amongſt the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114572:92"/>
but onely the Contingentials of Politick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe conſcience is the onely law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and rule whereby the merits of theſe duties are to be judged; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. laſt; where ſpeaking of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Priviledges and Ceremonies, he enjoyneth the dictates of conſcience to be obſerved under no leſſe ſanction then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him that diſobeyeth: of which doctrine, his owne practice concerning the Sacrament of Circumciſion is a manifeſt confirmation; for though he cauſed <hi>Timothy</hi> to be circumciſed becauſe of the Jewes who were perſwaded, that none who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned that Ceremony, were members of the true Church, or fit for their aſſociation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.3. yet he would not permit <hi>Titus</hi> to be circumciſed, becauſe the Grecians ſhould be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he did not eſteeme theſe Ceremonies ſo eſſentiall to life and ſalvation, that they ought to be obtruded upon thoſe, whoſe conſciences were not ſatisfied concerning the ſame, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3. And you may obſerve, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles conſulted of ſending decrees, concerning the obſervation of Ceremonies to the Gentiles; upon whom the Jewes would have obtruded the obſervation of Circumciſion, as neceſſary to ſalvation; they were carefull to enjoyne neither Circumciſion nor any other Ceremony, but ſuch as thoſe, of the Religion whereof the Gentiles were formerly ſatisfied in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore, if the Magiſtrate ſhall by any Law or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute compell men to practiſe thoſe Ceremonies or Formes of worſhip, concerning the Religion and lawfulneſſe whereof they are not ſatisfied in their conſciences, hee doth compell them to ſinne, and thereby render himſelfe guilty of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to be the merits of all injuries done to the conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> All the godly Kings of Judah; as, <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Joaſh, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> did impoſe the obſervation and practiſe of the Jewiſh ſacraments, and other Evangelicall formes of worſhip upon the whole nation of the Jewes, and alſo puniſh the neglect thereof: and therefore Kings may lawfully exerciſe their power in theſe matters, over all ſubjects within their Dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:114572:93"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God had revealed, and expreſly enjoyned the uſe of theſe Sacraments, and ſet Formes of Worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline, unto the whole nation of the Jewes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jewes were obliged thereunto, (not by the Lawes of the King, but) by the immediate law of God, within whoſe cognizance, both theſe Evangelicall ceremonies, and conſcience it ſelfe alſo, the Judge of all theſe, doth directly fall; over which, God onely, and not the King is Judge: ſo that when theſe Kings did exerciſe their Judiciary power concerning theſe Jewiſh rites, it was onely in purſuance of the law of God, which made theſe duties generally obligatory unto that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it was not lawfull for thoſe Kings, to force the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and obſervance of theſe duties upon any other people, though they lived within their Dominions; nor doe we finde in Scripture, that any of theſe godly Kings did force the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites who were their ſubjects, (but no Iſraelites) either to be circumciſed, or to eat the Paſſeover, or obſerve any other Jewiſh Rites. Onely indeed, if any ſtranger became a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, and ſo a profeſſour of that Religion, not by conſtraint, but of their owne voluntary inclination and deſire, then it was lawfull for the Magiſtrate to force ſuch to obſerve the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ceremonies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. becauſe then the neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was an act of profaneneſſe in ſuch (as well as in the Jewes) which is directly of Politicall Cognizance, and pertaines to the Magiſtrate both to judge and puniſh.</p>
               <p>But in regard the inward ſatisfaction of conſcience concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe Evangelicall Formes of Worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline, is that alone which doth naturalize theſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall duties, and thereby quarter them <hi>in praedicamento Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> and transforme them into matters of Politicall Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. And the inward diſſatisfaction of conſcience that which impedeth their naturalization, and the removall of their quarters <hi>de praedicamento extra-regalium,</hi> the proper ſphere of all Metapoliticall matters; (which inward qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience is properly a point of faith, and ſo a duty of the firſt Commandement of the Morall law:) for till we be ſo fully ſatisfied concerning the Religion of theſe Evangelicall Ceremonies, and Formes of Worſhip, that the practiſe thereof
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114572:93"/>
may proceed from faith, neither can wee adventure upon the voluntary practiſe thereof, or the Magiſtrate enforce the ſame upon us, without the incurment of the guilt of damnation to both.) I ſhall therefore referre the more punctuall diſcuſſion of this point unto the next Theſis, which concernes the <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modò extra-regalia,</hi> whereunto it doth more properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine.</p>

                     <hi>Theſis.</hi> 3.</note> And this relates to Internall duties and matters of Evangelicall faith and doctrine, which is this: No internall duties preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the firſt Commandement of the Morall Law, doe either directly or indirectly fall within the ſphere of Politicall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, ſo that the King cannot lawfully exerciſe either his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative or Judiciarie power in matters of faith and doctrine; nor by any poſitive Lawes and Statutes, determine what points ſhall be Orthodox, and what Hereticall: neither may he under the ſanction of any perſonall, or pecuniarie mulct, or penalty, enjoyne his Subjects to profeſſe and ſweare ſuch Creeds, and Articles of Faith and Religion, as thoſe Lawes ſhall make Orthodox: or by virtue of thoſe Lawes puniſh any of his Subjects, who out of conſcience doe profeſſe themſelves of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons for confirmation hereof are three.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof appeares partly in the premiſes, declaring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> no humane power or authority, to extend unto the acts of the ſoule; becauſe the ſoule doth derive its being immediately from God himſelfe, and not from our parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth (not every body, but) <hi>every ſoule to be ſubject to the higher powers, Rom.</hi> 13.1. thereby importing the Kings power to extend unto the acts of the ſoule, as well as the acts of the body; ſo that not onely the Externall, but alſo the Internall duties of the Morall Law, muſt come within the ſphere of Politicall Cognizance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> That exhortation of <hi>Pauls</hi> is not directed unto Kings, but unto Subjects, and therefore doth not relate unto the Kings power, but unto the Subjects obedience: For though the King cannot judge the acts of the ſoule, or puniſh the thoughts of the heart, (how unjuſt, impious, or Atheiſticall ſoever;) yet
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114572:94"/>
doth not that priviledge the Subjects to performe their acts of obedience out of hypocriſie, and diſſimulation, and <hi>with eye-ſervice,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.6.) And not out of <hi>ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart: for wrath and not for conſcience ſake.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe this duty of obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Kings, is not meerly a ſervice to Kings, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to God himſelfe, (whoſe perſon the King doth repreſent) who ſeeth and judgeth the ſecrets of our ſoules, and meaſureth the merits of our duty, not by our outward worke, but by our inward faith and love. And therefore (though the Kings power cannot, yet) our obedience muſt be extended even to the acts of the ſoule, that it may be an acceptable ſacrifice to God, as well as the King; but this doth not authorize the King to exerciſe his power over the acts of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Reaſon is grounded upon Chriſts ordinance for the plantation and promulgation of the Goſpell and faith of Chriſt, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Goe ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpell.</hi> This is all the commiſſion which the Apoſtles had, (and which other Miniſters ſtill have) for the converſion of men to the Faith and Religion of Chriſt. And yet they were ſent to convert the Gentiles, a people who neither underſtood or beleeved any thing at all, either of Chriſt, or Scripture, or any principles of that Faith and Religion; nor were any way inclined to ſeeke after ſuch knowledge. It's true indeed that Chriſt endowed his Apoſtles with a power farre beyond the power of Magiſtrates; for it was a power to worke miracles, but that was not for the puniſhment or deſtruction of any, but for the benefit and preſervation of all ſuch, upon whom they were ſhewed, which was a fit meanes to perſwade and convince their underſtandings: but wee never read that Chriſt did dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any Legiſlative or Judiciarie power unto his Apoſtles, to puniſh any miſ-beleevers, or enforce the profeſſion of thoſe truths and points of faith, which they could not perſwade; nay indeed, he peremptorily inhibited them the affectation of any ſuch power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25. whereupon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth Presbyters, not to demeane themſelves in the execution of their office <hi>as lords over Gods heritage.</hi> And yet it is the duty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and not of Magiſtrates, to reforme errours in matters
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114572:94"/>
of Faith and Doctrine; for we doe not read that ever Chriſt gave any rule or command to Kings, or Magiſtrates, to plant or propagate his Faith and Goſpell: and therefore in relation to theſe duties, the Miniſters, and not the Magiſtrates, are ſtiled Fathers, becauſe it is the duty and office of Miniſters, and not of Magiſtrates, <hi>to beget men in Christ Jeſus through the Goſpell,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. Eſay</hi> prophecying of the flouriſhing eſtate of Chriſts Church among the Gentiles, under the Goſpell, reciteth this for a ſpeciall meanes of the encreaſe thereof, that <hi>Kings ſhall be the nurſing fathers, and Queenes the nurſing mothers of the Church in thoſe dayes, Eſay</hi> 49.23. whoſe office it is by power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and not by preaching to perſwade men to forſake the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their wayes: And therefore Kings being fathers to the Church of Chriſt, may execute the duties of their calling over the members thereof; and by conſequence, may exerciſe both their Legiſlative and Judiciarie power in matters of Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine, which is that which conſtitutes men mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church, and gives the <hi>nomen &amp; eſſe</hi> to a Chriſtian, <hi>quà talis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The attribute which this Text giveth unto Kings, doth admirably expreſſe the duty of Chriſtian Kings towards their Subjects, in reference to their Chriſtian, and ſpirituall vocation, and profeſſion. For Kings are not here ſimply ſtiled fathers, as in other places of Scripture, which relate directly to their power and ſoveraignty over their Subjects; but with the addition of this Epithet of Nurſing, they ſhall be (ſaith the Text) <hi>Nurſing fathers:</hi> now a Nurſe you know doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a child, but onely protect and nouriſh it, after it is both begotten and borne.</p>
               <p>And ſuch a power indeed, a Chriſtian King may, and ought to exerciſe over his Subjects; that is, after they are begotten and borne children of the Faith and Church of Chriſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell; he both may and ought to uſe his power to protect them from the wolviſh enemies of Chriſts Church, and to nouriſh them by gracious expreſſes of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all favour. But I cannot finde any warrant for the King in that Text, to enact any Lawes or Statutes, to compell men of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114572:95"/>
another Faith and Religion to become ſuch as himſelfe, or to puniſh them that will not; nor can I beleeve it to be any part of his commiſſion or calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It may be replied againſt this, firſt, That ſuch a liberty, for every man to profeſſe and beleeve what his owne phantaſie doth ſuggeſt and judge Orthodox in ſuch high and ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries will fill the Church with abſurd, and blaſphemous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and hereſies; and by conſequence, the Common-wealth with diſtractions and diviſions. For it is a <hi>probatum</hi> of daily experience, that when the people are madded and inſtigated by mad <hi>Sheba's</hi> and Sectaries, they will adventure upon any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, ſparing neither <hi>Scepter nor Mitre, Ephod nor Diadom,</hi> fancying the cauſe to be Gods, and that themſelves doe God good ſervice, when they rage againſt his Anointed, and kill his Prophets with the ſword, in the furious purſuit of their fanaticke opinions.</p>
               <p>And therefore, there is a neceſſity that Kings ſhould exerciſe their power to ſettle an Uniformity in matters of Faith and Doctrine, becauſe the peace, and unity, and preſervation of the Common-wealth, doth ſo directly depend thereupon. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Primitive Church hath afforded us many laudable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents to this purpoſe, in many Creeds, and briefe formes of Confeſſions, purpoſely compoſed by the Fathers and Councels of thoſe times, to the end, that a profeſſed Uniformity of Faith and Doctrine in ſuch Fundamentals, might preſerve the peace and unity of the Church, and by conſequence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. And therefore, there wants neither reaſon nor authority to warrant the exerciſe of Regall power in matters of Faith and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This Uniformity of Faith and Religion, is more to be deſired then hoped for; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath expreſly declared the neceſſity of ſuch a diſſonancie amongſt Chriſtians in the principles of Faith and Religion, as ſhall alſo introduce divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diſcords amongſt them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 19. in which Text, the Apoſtle alledgeth the providence of God to be the ground thereof, who thereby provides for the manifeſtation of the ſincere and faithfull, and alſo for their better information and knowledge in matters of faith. And ſurely the Goſpell
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114572:95"/>
had never beene ſo perfectly radicated in the mindes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, without oppoſitions and diſputes concerning the ſame; and therefore it proceeded from the wiſdome, providence, and goodneſſe of God towards his children, that theſe diviſions ſhould be the fruits and effects of the Goſpel, (as Chriſt himſelf did forewarne his Diſciples) for Chriſtians are alwayes beſt principled in thoſe points which are moſt controverted; for the diſputes concerning Jewiſh Ceremonies in the times of the Apoſtles; concerning the Trinity in the times of the Fathers; concerning the nature of Juſtification, of the Sacraments, and other points of Popery, of later times; and concerning formes of Worſhip, Government, and Diſcipline of the Church, in theſe preſent times, hath begotten a more exact underſtanding in Chriſtians in all theſe points, then ever they had in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility attained unto, if Satan had not ſowed theſe ſeeds of diſcord amongſt them. As for the dangers and inconveniencies to Church and Common-wealth, pretended for the neceſſity of the exerciſe of a Regall power in theſe matters; it is but a piece of <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> policy, in erecting golden Calves to ſecure his kingdome: for to pretend a neceſſity of unwarrantable meanes, for the ſecurity of Church or State, is but to appeale from God to the Devill for ſuccour; which will certainly bring our feares upon us: For it is juſt with God to powre downe thoſe judgements upon the true Profeſſours, which are due to ſuch Hereticks, when the former ſort out of diffidence of Gods wiſdome, power, and goodneſſe, will anticipate his Juſtice in the latter, and out of a precipitate zeale to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, obtrude their undeſired, (and therefore unwelcome) help and aſſiſtance upon him. Whereas if wee could but <hi>let them alone</hi> (as Chriſt exhorteth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14.) and waite Gods time with patience, the Lord will not faile to root out ſuch ſpurious plants, which are not of his owne planting, but of the Devils, as all ſuch Hereſies moſt undoubtedly are. Yet I deny not but the Magiſtrate both may, and ought to exercice his power for the reſtraine and puniſhment of thoſe diviſions, (which are the fruits and effects of theſe erroneous and Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call opinions,) when they come to be of Politicall Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Common-wealth; but the errours themſelves which are the cauſes and productives of theſe miſchiefes in State, are not at all of Politicall, but of another higher Cognizance. As for the conciſe formes of Faith and Confeſſion, mentioned in the latter part of the Objection, I doe acknowledge ſuch ſhort Creeds, (as that of the Apoſtles, of the Nicene Councell, of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and many other Orthodox Creeds, deviſed, ſome by Councels, ſome by particular Fathers, againſt ſuch particular Hereſies as raigned in their times,) to be of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſe and expediency for the Churches edification: but for any Magiſtrate to conſtraine his Subjects by virtue of any Law or Statute, to ſweare the truth of theſe Creeds, or of any other Article of Faith, of the truth whereof the deponent is not firſt fully ſatisfied in his conſcience, (but doth either beleeve or doubt the ſame to be falſe) muſt needs be an offence of a very high nature in any Magiſtrate; becauſe he doth not onely ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe acceſſary to the perjury of him that ſweares, but guilty alſo of a ſacrilegious intruſion and uſurpation upon thoſe ſacred prerogatives which God hath reſerved entire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe: <hi>viz.</hi> of the power and command over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which God never imparted unto any Creature, Man, or Angell; neither of whom (how great and glorious ſoever) is able to pacifie an injured, incenſed, and wrathfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Reaſon is taken from the inefficacy of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive meanes to plant the faith of Chriſt, manifeſted in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning his demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who ſhould oppoſe themſelves againſt the truth and Goſpell of Chriſt, not onely of infirmity and ignorance, but of obſtinacy and maliouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. towards whom he exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> to be gentle, and inſtruct them with meekneſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. And yet wee know that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not want experience of the efficacy and vertue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive and violent courſes to force a conformity in others, to his owne faith, belief, and profeſſion: and therefore, ſurely he would never have ſo carefully preſcribed this rule to <hi>Timothy,</hi> if he had found perſecution, and the exerciſe of ſecular power to be a better expedient to convert men to the faith of Chriſt, or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114572:96"/>
to convince an erroneous conſcience; the incongruity of which meanes alſo, the Lord himſelfe hath further manifeſted, by rendring all ſuch inordinate endeavours, (not onely fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and inefficacious for the eradication of Hereſies, but alſo) advantageous to confirme them in the parties perſecuted, and to multiply the profeſſours of the ſame Hereticall opinions; as the Hiſtories of the Primitive Perſecutions doe ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For there is ſo much diſproportion betweene an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall conſcience and a materiall ſword, that the weakeſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are apt to conclude, that thoſe who make uſe of ſuch abſurd and improper arguments to convince the conſciences of others, are not provided of better grounds and reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to build their owne Faith and Religion. And hee that conſulteth the Narratives of the Spaniſh proceedings in the Converſion of the Indians, ſhall finde that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> added more ſoules to the Church of Chriſt by one Sermon, then the Spaniards were able to doe by ſeven yeares perſecution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was not defective in any point of ſavage and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cruelty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Many perverſe natures have beene converted to the faith of Chriſt by rigorous meanes, upon whom perſwaſions and argumentations could have no ſuch influence: and we find by daily experience, that correction and ſtripes are a meanes to infuſe documents into ſome children, in whoſe ſoules the moſt rationall inſtructions with meekneſſe could make no ſuch impreſſion.</p>

                  <hi>Sol. Balaams</hi> Aſſe ſpoke when ſhee was beaten three times with a ſtaffe; and yet a man would eſteeme him an Aſſe, that ſhould endeavour to make an Aſſe ſpeake by beating her three times as often. I grant that corrections and puniſhments may be efficacious to engraft knowledge and beliefe in mens minds, of thoſe principles whereof nature doth make them capable, and where negligence or lewdneſs are the only impediments, as it happeneth in ſome children; but for a Magiſtrate to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the engraftment and plantation of Chriſtian principles in the heart of an Infidel, (who is prepoſſeſt with a prejudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their fond and ſuperſtitious vanity) by rigour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, would be an abſurdity no leſſe ridiculous, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114572:97"/>
to make an Aſſe ſpeak, by beating her three times with a ſtaffe. In regard nature doth afford no more capacity in men for the beliefe of theſe points of faith, then it doth in Aſſes to ſpeake, or in ſtones to live, whereof onely God (who enabled <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe to ſpeake) <hi>is able to raiſe up children unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> That is, God is onely able to implant the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in the hearts of Infidels, who are as incapable thereof by nature, as ſtones are of life and motion. And the means which God hath ordained for this purpoſe, (and whereupon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can onely expect a bleſſing from God to make them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall) is not rigour and compulſion, but meekneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declares, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25.</p>

And therefore the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may exerciſe both his Legiſlative and Judiciary power, for the reſtraint and ſuppreſſion of all Idolatrous worſhip, and particularly of Images, which is the Idolatrous forme of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip practiſed by Papiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is a twofold fountaine and originall of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The will:</hi> when the errour and obliquity doth proceed either from a wicked lewdneſſe, or elſe from a perverſe and wilfull negligence; and ſuch were all the Idolatries of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralites, becauſe God himſelfe had publiſhed Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for the information of their underſtandings in that point; the Juſtice and Religion whereof was not diſputable, becauſe they were immediately from God: And therefore, theſe Idolatries were puniſhable in the Iſraelites, becauſe they did proceed from the errour and obliquity of the <hi>wilt;</hi> the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114572:97"/>
                  <hi>Reformation</hi> whereof, is indeed the very abſolute and adaequate end of all puniſhments, and of the exerciſe of all Politicall power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The understanding:</hi> when the errour and obliquity doth proceed from an invincible ignorance, and miſapprehenſion of the Religion of the duty; (as in the Papiſts, whoſe formes of worſhip, (how Idolatrous ſoever in the eyes of Proteſtants, yet) in their owne eyes appeare to be the onely ſervice accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: And in the Gentiles, whoſe ridiculous and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Idolatry, was had in the like religious and reverent eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt themſelves;) the puniſhment of which Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is no leſſe incongruous, then to beat a naturall foole for liking his owne painted coate better then my rich ſuite, or a blinde man for judging that to be white, which I that have eyes can diſcerne to be perfectly blacke. For though the light of nature in its perfection (in which ſenſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.) be a ſufficient guide in all theſe particular things, (that is, to diſcerne the errours of theſe Idolaters, as well as the miſtakes of fooles and blind men) yet is it not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to doe that in theſe particular men, who doe not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of ſuch a perfection of naturall light and knowledge: and therefore (till it pleaſe God to enlighten their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) it is as impoſſible to cudgell theſe Idolaters out of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Religion of their owne formes of worſhip, or to make them beleeve any other to be more innocent, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, as with a hammer to drive wit into a fooles head, or ſight into a blind mans eyes. And therefore (ſeeing puniſhments were never ordained for the <hi>Information of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> but meerly for the <hi>Reformation of the will;</hi>) it cannot be juſt nor equitable in Magiſtrates, to puniſh the errours and obliquities of Papiſts, or any other Idolaters, (which have their foundation and ground in the underſtanding,) till firſt their underſtanding be rightly informed, and themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the errour of their wayes. And to warrant this Doctrine, wee have firſt a preſident in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, in the converſion of the Athenians, who did not make uſe of powder and bullets, but of demonſtrations and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to effect that great worke of Reformation in thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114572:98"/>
as we may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. Secondly, the teſtimony of <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> who judged no accuſations concerning theſe Ceremonies alledged by the Jewes againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> to be worthy of death, or bonds, or any puniſhment, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Papiſts have the benefit of Scripture for their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which apparently condemne their Idolatrous formes of worſhip: and therefore their Idolatry cannot be excuſed by the pretence of an invincible ignorance, no more then the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of the Iſraelites could be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The Aethiopian Eunuch had the benefit of Scripture too, when he underſtood little enough of Chriſt; and for ought I know, might have continued an Idolater all his life, if <hi>Philip,</hi> in ſtead of expounding and reaſoning, had fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cudgelling that ignorant Eunuch into a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. And therefore it is requiſite, that they ſhould firſt be convinced by reaſon, that the Scriptures doe condemne their formes of worſhip as Idolatrous, before they be puniſhed for the practiſe thereof. Neither againe, is the reaſon and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Law for puniſhing Idolatry the ſame in the Papiſts, as it was in the Iſraelites, for two cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the different nature of the ſinne; for the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry principally intended by that Law to be puniſhed in the Iſraelites, was the worſhip of an Idolatrous object, (as appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.) whereof the Papiſts are no wayes guilty, (for they worſhip the ſame God in the Unity of Eſſence, and Trinity of Perſons, which the Proteſtants doe.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the different nature of the guilt, (though the ſinne ſhould be acknowledged to be the ſame in both, and the Idolatry puniſhable in the Iſraelites, to relate to the formes of worſhip of the true God, which is the onely ſpece of Idolatry that can be charged upon the Papiſts.) For the Iſraelites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, had ſet formes of worſhip preſcribed by God, from which the leaſt deviation was inexcuſable in them; but under the Goſpell, thoſe Ceremonies were abrogated, and all formes of worſhip left unto the diſcretion of the Church: Now the Papiſts preſuming their Church to be both the true Church, and infallible, and that alſo by warrant of Scripture, (as they ſuppoſe) it cannot be imagined, that they can poſſibly

underſtand or beleeve thoſe formes of worſhip which they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by the direction of their Church, to be Idolatrous: and therefore their errours in this kind, deſerve rather to be the object of our pity, then our wrath.</p>
               <p>Much more is requiſite to complete this diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the limitation of the Kings power in order to theſe <hi>extra-regalia,</hi> and Metapoliticall matters; and more particularly, concerning the limitation thereof, in order to the calling and office of Miniſters, which is not ſubordinate, but of a different degree and nature from the office of Kings, both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Anointed of God, and neither of them depending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly upon the other, but onely <hi>in ordine ad ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem tertium: viz.</hi> God, unto whom they both are ſervants, and from whom immediately they doe both receive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and neither of them from other. For as the King hath no father or ſuperiour but God himſelfe, in his Politick and ſacred capacity, (as we have already demonſtrated) ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Miniſter in his Eccleſiaſticall and ſacred capacity, as Chriſt himſelfe declareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.9. And therefore, though the Apoſtles both taught and practiſed obedience to Magiſtrates, in all matters of Politicall Cognizance, wherein it was lawfull for the Magiſtrate to command; yet did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> refuſe to obey the commands of the Jewiſh Rulers, in matters which immediately related to their office and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. and ſo did other of the Apoſtles alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.29. For ſurely, if Miniſters were obliged to obey the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in the execution of the duties of their calling, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt had never attained unto ſuch a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and maturity, nor Chriſtianity ever taken root in the world, eſpecially amongſt the Jewes; for the two prementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chapters of <hi>Acts</hi> 4. and 5. and many other Texts in the <hi>Acts,</hi> doe ſufficiently manifeſt, by what ſtrict lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the Jewiſh Rulers and Magiſtrates, interdicted the publication thereof. But the accurate diſcuſſion of this point, concerning the Kings power over Miniſters, in reference to their perſons, eſtates, and callings, would ſwell this Chapter into a larger volume, then was deſigned for the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. And therefore I will conclude this Chapter, with a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114572:99"/>
ſupplication to the Reader, concerning the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof, which is that my expreſſes therein, pleading the exemption of conſcience from all ſecular power, (in reference, firſt, to matters of Faith and Doctrine, which are neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly of Politicall Cognizance: Secondly, to matters of Evangelicall Worſhip, Government, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which are onely indirectly, and <hi>ex accidenti</hi> of Politicall Cognizance,) may not be ſo underſtood, as if thereby I ſhould intend to make the pretence either of conſcience, or of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall calling, to be a ſufficient warrant to authorize the reſiſtance of Secular power by any Subject, whether Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Civill. For as the Kings commands in Metapoliticall matters whereunto his Commiſſion doth not extend, doe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him guilty of ſacrilegious intruſion upon the ſacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of God; ſo the Subjects reſiſtance, and deniall of a paſſive obedience, though even in thoſe Metapoliticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, doe render them guilty of a ſacrilegious intruſion upon the ſacred Prerogatives of the King, to whom God hath dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated an abſolute, and unlimited power, over both our eſtates and perſons: in reſiſtance whereof, we become guilty of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion both againſt God and the King; as the next Chapter will more fully manifeſt, ſpeaking the due extenſion of the Subjects obedience.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the due extenſion of the Subjects obedience.</head>
               <p>THe ninth Chapter preſented the Reader with two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals concerning the ends of Monarchy: The firſt whereof concerned their <hi>nature;</hi> the explication whereof, was the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand both of that and the tenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond concerneth their <hi>order,</hi> in the diſcuſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our principall deſigne is, to declare in this preſent Chapter, the due extenſion of the Subjects obedience, and that it is their duty to preferre the Kings honour before their owne welfare, in all matters of Politicall Cognizance.</p>
               <p>You may remember that in that ninth Chapter, I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114572:99"/>
the adaequate end of Monarchy into <hi>principalem, &amp; minus principalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principall end, is either <hi>primus,</hi> which is <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> or <hi>à primo ortus,</hi> which is <hi>the Kings Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The leſſe principall end, is <hi>ſalus populi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning theſe three ends of Monarchy, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that they are not coordinate, but ſubordinate, and ought all of them to have an influence upon every Monarchicall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it proceed from Monarchs or Monarchiſts; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which three, the firſt and principall is <hi>the Glory of God,</hi> which both parties ought principally to look upon in all their relative actions, whether of power or obedience: for that is the finall cauſe for which God ordained the King to rule and governe, and the people to be ruled and governed. So that the degrees of order and ſubordination amongſt theſe three ends of Monarchy, in reference to the duties both of King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtands thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The King ought to conſult and endeavour (by way of power) the <hi>peoples ſafety,</hi> in order to his <hi>owne Honour;</hi> and to endeavour both his <hi>owne Honour</hi> and the <hi>peoples ſafety,</hi> in order to the <hi>Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The people ought to endeavour (by way of obedience and ſubmiſſion) their <hi>owne ſafety</hi> in order to the <hi>Kings Honour;</hi> and to endeavour both the <hi>Kings Honour,</hi> and their <hi>own ſafety,</hi> in order to the <hi>Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe the true underſtanding of this order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of degrees amongſt theſe ends, doth much conduce to the right underſtanding of the Subjects duty; I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to manifeſt this ſubordination by propoſing,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moſt materiall Objections and Arguments, which ſeeme to diſprove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The moſt materiall Grounds and Reaſons which doe confirme it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By framing Reſolutions upon theſe grounds, to thoſe Objections.</p>
               <p>Indeed the preheminence of the firſt of theſe ends (which is <hi>Gods Glory,</hi>) is not a point diſputable amongſt Chriſtians. But whether the <hi>Kings Honour</hi> may juſtly claime the ſecond place,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114572:100"/>
and ought to be preferred before the <hi>peoples ſafety</hi> in all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall actions, is not ſo unanimouſly agreed upon; for (though many beleeve that the Monarch may obſerve this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in his owne actions, yet) that the people both may, and ought to preferre their <hi>owne ſafety</hi> before the <hi>Kings Honour,</hi> is an opinion that hath not wanted ſtore of Patrons in theſe times: And the principall Arguments whereupon they ground the ſame, are three.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> The firſt is grounded upon the Law of Nature; which is never repugnant (but ſubordinate and conformable) unto the Law of God; and indeed properly a part of Gods Law. For the will of God, (which is the very adaequate Law of God) doth receive diverſe denominations, from the diverſe limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame, unto diverſe objects: as, Firſt, that part of his will which concerneth Angels, is termed the law of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Secondly, that which concerneth men, (I meane in their naturall duty towards God and their neighbour;) (for man never received Law, but that before his Redemption, and thoſe Lawes which relate to Redemption, are not properly naturall, but ſupernaturall Lawes) is termed the Law of Nature, (<hi>i. e.</hi> humane,) or the Law of the rationall nature. Thirdly, that part of Gods will which concerneth naturall Agents, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Law of Nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the Law of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Nature.</p>
               <p>Againe, this ſecond ſort of Law, (which is the Law of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or rationall Nature, and is grounded upon the will of God concerning mankind,) is divided by Chriſt himſelfe into two parts, which he termes two Commandements, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.27. Which two are differenced by two different Objects, and two different ſorts of love required of us, for the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our different duties, unto theſe two different Objects. The firſt Commandement relates to God, whom we muſt love above our ſelves, and all that we call ours; for God doth not allow any man to value, either life, limbe, liberty, or eſtate, above himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 39. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Marke</hi> 8.35. and of this nature are all the particular Commandements of the firſt Table, which are comprehended under this generall and great Commandement; the duties whereof are grounded
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114572:100"/>
upon a love exceeding the love of our ſelves. The ſecond Commandement relates unto our Neighbour; whom wee are not obliged to love either above our ſelves, or equally with our ſelves, but onely like our ſelves; ſo that the love of our ſelves in this ſecond part of the Law of Nature, is allowed the firſt place; and wee may lawfully value our owne life, limbs, eſtates, and liberties, above our neighbours, and preferre the indempnity of our ſelves, before the indempnity of our neighbour, in each of theſe ſeverall reſpects, (when they chance to come in competition.) And therefore no Law, either of God or man, doth make homicide capitall, (no nor culpable) where it is neceſſitated <hi>ſe defendendo.</hi> And of this nature are all the particular Commandements of the ſecond Table, which Chriſts expoſition comprehends under this ſecond generall Commandement, (Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe) the duties whereof are grounded upon a love (not exceeding, but) inferiour unto the love of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the Kings Honour being grounded upon the fifth Commandement, (which they take <hi>pro conceſſe</hi> to be a Precept of the ſecond Table) and therefore grounded upon a love which muſt not exceed the love of our ſelves; the people are obliged by the Law of God and Nature, (in all their duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King,) in the firſt place to looke upon their <hi>owne ſafety;</hi> and by conſequence, the <hi>Kings Honour</hi> is (not a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but) a ſubordinate end to <hi>ſalus populi;</hi> ſo that the people may reſiſt, yea and kill the King alſo, if they be neceſſitated <hi>ſe defendendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> A ſecond Argument which they urge for a further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, is the inſtance of a Generall or Governour of a city, who (though his Commiſſion be never ſo large, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to life, liberty, and eſtate, yet) if he ſhall (contrary to his truſt repoſed in him for defence of that city) turne the Canon againſt the city to deſtroy it, may lawfully be reſiſted by the city and Souldiery, (and that by armes and violence) as a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to his truſt: and therefore if the King ſhall breake the truſt repoſed in him by God, the people may (like this city and ſouldiery) lawfully reſiſt him as a a traitour to his truſt, and provide for their owne ſafety before his honour.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:114572:101"/>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> Laſtly, they alledge out of Scripture, ſeverall inſtances of Kings that have beene reſiſted by the people, in order to their owne ſafety; wherein the actions of the people have beene ſometimes expreſly approved by God; as in the depoſition of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> from his dominion over the ten Tribes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.24. And ſometimes countenanced by holy men of God, which themſelves have been the principall actors therein: (as <hi>David</hi> in the defence of himſelfe from the rage and fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.1, 2. and Chap. 23.7, 8. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> in his adviſe to the Elders, to reſiſt the meſſengers ſent by King <hi>Jehoram,</hi> to take away his head, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.32.) and yet neither of them reproved by God for preferring their owne ſafety, before their obedience to the Kings commands: And therefore the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may provide for, and regard their <hi>owne ſafety,</hi> rather then <hi>his Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Doctrine which I ſhall here premiſe, as a ground for the ſolution of theſe Arguments, and to evidence the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the <hi>Kings Honour</hi> above the <hi>peoples welfare,</hi> is ſuch a principle in Divinity, as I preſume will <hi>(prima facie)</hi> hazzard the repute of a Paradox, being directly oppoſite to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Chriſtian Authors who write of the Morall Law; who diſtinguiſhing the Ten Commandements into two Tables (according to Chriſts rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37.) doe generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the fift Commandement, (preſcribing honour to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) to be a Commandement of the ſecond Table, which containeth our duty towards our neighbour; as if Kings and parents related to their Subjects and children, as neighbours, and not as Gods. And that the duties therefore to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Kings and parents, are grounded onely upon ſuch a love, which muſt not exceed the love of our ſelves: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted for truth, the Argument taken from the Law of Nature, to prove the preheminence of the <hi>peoples welfare</hi> above the <hi>Kings Honour,</hi> (and thereby to legitimate the reſiſtance of Kings, as well as of any other men, when the people doe judge their commands to be deſtructive to their owne ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,) is altogether unanſwerable. For Chriſt in that premen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diviſion of the Morall Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. makes but two objects of mans duty; one ſuperiour, whom wee are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114572:101"/>
to love and reſpect above our ſelves, and that is God: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour object, whom wee are obliged to reſpect onely as our ſelves; that is, in the reſpect of the degrees of extenſion of our love equally to our ſelves; (for wee muſt have a regard unto our neighbour, in his perſon, and life, chaſtity, goods, and good name, as well as our owne:) but yet we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to an equality, in reference to the degrees of the intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our love to our neighbour in any of theſe particulars; for we may, and ought to love and reſpect our own life, goods, and good name, above our neighbours: ſo that every man is ſet in the middle betweene theſe two objects; to the one hee lookes upward as an object above him, to the other downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as an object below him: So that if Kings and parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to us only as neighbours, and not as Gods, (for there is no other third object of mans duty,) then they are not our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours but inferiours; nor may we reſpect their perſons, goods, or good name, above our owne, as things ſacred; but beneath, and after our owne, and ſo to preſerve our owne, may deſtroy theirs: which Doctrine doth plainly legitimate rebellion by the Law of Nature. And therefore, to prevent both this, and many other dangerous and damnable inferences, which may be deduced from this fundamental errour, (placing this fift Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement under a wrong <hi>genus</hi> of the Morall Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by putting a wrong conſtruction upon all the duties therein preſcribed;) I ſhall endeavour to rectifie this Epidemicall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, by twelve Reaſons or Arguments, demonſtrating this fift Commandement, to be a Precept, not of the ſecond, but of the firſt Table of the Morall Law. Whereof,</p>
               <p>The firſt foure doe conclude the Negative part, that it is not a Precept of the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>The latter eight the Affirmative part, that it is a Precept of the firſt Table.</p>
               <p>The Negative part, that it is no Precept of the ſecond Table, appeares,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> expoſition of that leſſer Commandement, whereby Chriſt divides the ſecond Table from the firſt; viz. <hi>(Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,)</hi> under which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (ſaith the Apoſtle) are comprehended all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114572:102"/>
of the ſecond Table, relating to our neighbour; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing them, mentions onely the laſt five, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> You will ſay, though he ſpecifie no other but the five laſt Precepts of the Decalogue, yet he intimateth in that verſe, that ſome other Commandement is alſo comprehended in this ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe;</hi> which other Commandement muſt needs be this, of obedience to parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> By other Commandement, the Apoſtle doth not mean any of the other five which are ſpecifically diſtinct from theſe five, but other particular branches of theſe five Negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the ſecond Table, each of which comprehends many particulars under them: and that hee doth not thereby underſtand this fift Commandement, which is an Affirmative Precept, is manifeſt from the Reaſon alledged by the Apoſtle in the ſubſequent verſe; ſhewing why, and how this love of our neighbour is the fulfilling of the Law of the ſecond Table: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore is love the fulfilling of the Law, Ver.</hi> 10. Where you may obſerve, that all the duties of the ſecond Table relating to our neighbour, are grounded primarily upon the Negative effects of our love, which is the not doing ill to our neighbour; (for not our neighbour, but our ſelves, are the immediate object of the poſitive effects of our love,) and ſo the Precepts are all expreſt by way of negation. But the duties of the fift Commandement are of a different nature, and conſiſts primarily in the poſitive effects of our love; and therefore this Precept is expreſt by way of affirmation, both in the Decalogue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt verſe of this Chapter. For firſt he commands us to ſubmit our ſelves to higher Powers, (that is, to perform and execute their commands, when they are not contrary to Gods Precepts,) and this is the immediate and primary duty of this fift Commandement: and in the next verſe hee prohibits all reſiſtance, (though their commands be ſuch as we judge to be contrary to Gods Precepts,) and this is the conſequentiall and ſecondarie duty of the ſame Commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Reaſon why this fift Commandement cannot be a precept of the ſecond Table, is, becauſe ſuch a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be ſuperfluous in the ſecond Table; for if the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114572:102"/>
honour and obedience due to Kings and parents, were duties of the ſecond Table, then they ſhould be grounded upon ſuch a love as is inferiour unto, and to be meaſured by the love of our ſelves; and wee ſhould yeeld our obedience and ſubmiſſion to their commands onely, when we judged them to conduce unto our own good and benefit; whereupon it would follow, that the honour due to Kings and parents ſhould be no other, then what is due to our friend, or ſervant, or any other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: (for nature teacheth us to obey and execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, when we conceive them to conduce unto our owne advantage,) and ſo this fift Commandement ſhould be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuperfluous: And therefore cannot be a Precept of the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon why this fift Commandement cannot be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Precept of the ſecond Table, is, becauſe God doth not permit us to accuſe or teſtifie againſt our parents upon any occaſion, no not in caſe of Idolatry; wherein wee were not to pity or ſpare any neighbour, how neare and dear ſoever they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; whether it were brother, childe, wife, or friend; but were to accuſe them, and teſtifie againſt them, and to execute the ſentence of death upon them, with our owne hands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. yea, if it were a whole city that were guilty of this ſinne, it was to be deſtroyed, <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Yet in this ſtrict charge concerning Idolatrous neighbours, of ſo neere relation, the Text doth not mention any man or woman, who hath the relation of a father or mother to us; thereby differencing them from all neighbours whatſoever. And <hi>Solomons</hi> expoſition of this fift Commandement, makes this more cleare and evident, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. where he extends the honour and reverence due to Kings, unto the very thoughts and imaginations of the heart, (notwithſtanding they were both Fooles, Tyrants, and Idolaters,) (for when <hi>Solomon</hi> prohibited the curſing of the King, yea even in the thought; he was not ignorant that <hi>Saul</hi> had beene a Tyrant, himſelfe an Idolater, and that his ſonne <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who ſhould ſucceed him, was a Fool.) But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prohibited to ſpeake, or think evill of any friend or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who was guilty of theſe crimes; nay, we are commanded to accuſe them of evill.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Kings, in reference to their duty towards God, may be more wicked then any other men, becauſe they may offend in a double capacity; 1. In their naturall, as men, and <hi>profeſſores fidei,</hi> by tranſgreſſing of Gods Commandements, which doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them equally, as they do other men. 2. In their Politick, as Gods Deputies, and <hi>propugnatores fidei,</hi> by breach of that truſt which God hath repoſed in them, for ruling and judging of the people committed to their care and protection, according to Juſtice and Equity. But in reference to their duty towards us, (though themſelves may be wicked, yet) they cannot doe wicked things, (as I ſhewed in the laſt Chapter,) that is, they cannot inflict any thing upon us, but that which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to fall upon us for our ſinnes; as the Holy Ghoſt teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>Pilates</hi> ſentence againſt Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. ſo that the evill which they doe to us, is juſt in reſpect of us, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unjuſtly executed by them. So that the words of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> are to be underſtood onely of Kings, in reference to the exerciſe of their power upon us; which whether it be for good or hurt, is ſtill from God, whoſe Deputies all Kings are, and whoſe heart the Lord ruleth, either for our benefit or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. And therefore we may not thinke them evill or unjuſt to us; for the Judgement is not theirs but Gods, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.29. who cannot be unjuſt. And if we looke in <hi>Eſay</hi> 3. you ſhall finde that God owneth all the grievous oppreſſions and violences, which Tyrants exerciſe upon their Subjects, for judgements and puniſhments ſent upon that people or nation by his owne ſelfe; and to demonſtrate, that all Kings act by his immediate direction, he hath made the decrees and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Heathen Kings ſubſervient to his glory, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good, not onely <hi>on accidenti,</hi> by his providence, but <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito,</hi> in their owne purpoſes; as is apparent in the decrees of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114572:104"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> to build the Temple of God, whom they knew not; and of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to honour his name: all which three were meere Heathens.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Reaſon why this fift Commandement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> cannot be a Precept of the ſecond Table, is, becauſe it doth not enjoyne ſuch a retaliation of love, as every Commandement of the ſecond Table doth; for every Commandement of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, doth enjoyne our neighbour to returne the like reſpects and meaſure of love to us, as we doe give to him: but this fift Commandement doth not enjoyne our parents to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence us, as we are bound thereby to honour and reverence them; therefore it cannot be a Commandement of the ſecond Table. And if you doe obſerve it, you ſhall finde this rule of Retaliation to be a perfect note of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the duties of the firſt, and of the ſecond Table; for no duty of the firſt Table doth oblige God to returne the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to us, which we are obliged to exhibite to him, for wee are bound to worſhip him, and love him above all, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this love in every faculty both of ſoule and body: but God is not obliged to worſhip us, nor to love us after ſuch a manner; but our neighbour is obliged to returne the ſame meaſure of love to us, which wee are bound to exhibite unto him, either in his body, goods, or good name.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe indeed that parents are engaged to performe duties to their children, as well as children are to parents; but thoſe are onely ſuch paternall duties of protection and proviſion, as God himſelfe is alſo obliged to performe unto his dutifull children, by his Covenant for conferring bleſſings upon them, when they truely honour him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and 29. for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the externall part of which Covenant, God doth ſubſtitute Kings and parents as his inſtruments, to convey theſe bleſſings unto Subjects and children; but theſe duties are not ſo much as intimated in the fift Commandement, but are enjoyned onely in that generall Covenant betweene God and his people; who therefore doth make Kings and parents indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ſubjects and children, whereby to expreſſe his care for performance upon his part, when Subjects and children are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114572:105"/>
obedient unto God and his Deputies, and thereby carefull to performe upon their part.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons concluding the Affirmative part, that this fift Commandement is a Precept of the firſt Table, are eight.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is grounded upon our Saviours anſwer to the young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Marke</hi> 10.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.20. In all which places, this Precept, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi> is intended by Chriſt to enjoyne all the duties of the firſt Table of the Morall Law; for God you know is often in Scripture ſtiled Father: as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. wee finde him ſtiled Father twelve times, but we never finde him ſtiled Neighbour in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for to love God but in the ſame manner which wee are bound to love our neighbour, (that is, like our ſelves,) were ſelfe Idolatry. And beſides our duty to God is oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in this very expreſſion of Honour: as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. where this word Honour importeth the whole duty of man towards God: in which ſenſe this word Honour is alſo uſed by our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 8.49. And therefore it is manifeſt, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is capable of the title of Father, and that this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Honour may be properly extended to all the duties due unto God, (which are the duties of the firſt Table) that this Precept of <hi>Honour thy father and mother,</hi> may comprehend all the duties of the firſt Table; and that it doth ſo in this place, I doe prove thus: Chriſt in his anſwer muſt needs mention all thoſe duties which are neceſſary to ſalvation, (for elſe his rule were not perfect:) but the duties of the firſt Table are equally, (if not more) neceſſary to life, then the duties of the ſecond Table; and cannot be included in any other Precept which Chriſt reciteth in thoſe Texts: therefore, all the duties of the firſt Table, muſt neceſſarily be comprehended in this Precept, <hi>Honour thy father and mother;</hi> upon which premiſed grounds it doth neceſſarily follow, that this fift Commandement is a Precept of the firſt Table. For,</p>
               <p>That Precept which comprehendeth all the duties of the firſt Table, muſt needs be a Precept of the firſt Table; but this very Precept comprehendeth all the duties of the firſt Table, as the premiſes demonſtrate: <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:114572:105"/>The ſecond Reaſon is grounded upon the nature of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is <hi>being and exiſtence;</hi> for in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. he defineth himſelf by this expreſſion, <hi>I am:</hi> and upon this ground, both <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third Reaſon, (as likewiſe all the five following,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> alledged by Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. for motives to perſwade ſubmiſſion to higher Powers, (every one of which Reaſons, doe demonſtrate Kings and Magiſtrates (who are Politick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) to have the relation of Gods unto the people) is taken from the Author of the Kings power, and that is God, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. <hi>For there is no power but of God.</hi> Though the men inveſted with that power be as unjuſt and wicked as <hi>Pilate,</hi> whoſe power Chriſt himſelfe acknowledged to flow from that ſacred foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>John</hi> 19.11. upon which ground, the King in the exerciſe of his power, is alwayes ſtiled the <hi>Minister of God Ver.</hi> 4. yea, and oftentimes alſo a very God; as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. And <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſtiled <hi>Aarons</hi> God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.16. And of theſe Gods Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant, when he affirmed many Gods to be in earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</p>
               <p>Now in regard the King doth repreſent the perſon of God, he is to be honoured, not according to what he is in himſelfe, and in his naturall capacity (that is, as a man) but according to what the perſon is whom hee repreſents, and that is God. For you know the reſpects which we exhibite to the Mayor of a towne, (which happily may be a Cobler) are not propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to the worth and honour of that Cobler, but according to the worth and honour of the King whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents: and therefore within thoſe limits (where that Cobler
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114572:106"/>
doth repreſent this Majeſty, and exerciſe this power derived from the King,) he is in all reſpects preferred above all other men of what quality ſoever, (though Knights or Lords,) and therefore our duties to the King, cannot relate to him in his naturall capacity, as a man; but in his Politick, as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the perſon of God; and by conſequence this fift Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement muſt be a Precept of the firſt Table.</p>
               <p>Some Jewiſh Writers upon this very ground and reaſon, do concurre in this opinion, that this fift Commandement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the firſt Table; becauſe Kings are ſtiled Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. and Miniſters of God: whereunto that learned and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divine <note n="*" place="margin">In his Tract upon the Morall Law. <hi>p. 105.</hi>
                  </note> Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> returneth this anſwer, That not onely ſuperiours, but alſo inferiours are included in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which excludes it from the firſt Table: But with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his great learning, and humble ſubmiſſion to better reaſon, I cannot in this particular captivate my aſſent either to his anſwer, opinion, or reaſon; for if that were ſufficient to ſeclude the fift, the ſame reaſon would exclude alſo the fourth Commandement out of the firſt Table; becauſe both ſon, and daughter, and maid, and man-ſervant; yea, even oxe and aſſe alſo, are therein expreſly mentioned. But that which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth the two Tables, is the object of the duty to whom it is to be performed, and not the ſubject who is to performe it. And wee doe not finde that the duties of the fift Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be performed to any inferiours, but onely to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. And beſides, this judicious Divine himſelfe (who is deſervedly honoured, both for piety and knowledge) (although he diſſent from this opinion, and in his diviſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, doth make this fift Commandement a Precept of the ſecond Table; yet) in that Argument which he alledgeth to perſwade the ſincerity of ſubmiſſion and obedience to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he proves it directly to be a Precept of the firſt. It pleaſed God (<note n="a" place="margin">In his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fift Commandement.</note> ſaith hee) to give this Commandement roome before our goods, yea, before our life, to ſhew that obedience to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt be preferred before either our eſtate or life: Now if Princes muſt be dearer to us then our ſelves, how can they have the relation of neighbours, upon whom the law of God doth not enjoyne us to ſet any ſuch eſtimate?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:114572:106"/>The fourth reaſon is taken from the nature of the ſinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which is the breach and tranſgreſſion of this Commandement, which is a ſinne immediately againſt God; <hi>For he that reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, Ver.</hi> 2. and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the Prince, is termed a Rebellion againſt God; as appeares, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.2, 3, 4. where the Lord doth threaten the puniſhment of the peoples Rebellion, upon the report of the ten ſpies; not as a ſinne againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> but againſt himſelfe. And ſo likewiſe the Rebellion of <hi>Korah</hi> is tearmed a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> but againſt God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.3. And Chriſt ſaith, thoſe that deſpiſe his Meſſengers, deſpiſe him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.16. And the Prodigall acknowledgeth his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his father, to be a ſinne, firſt againſt heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he that deſpiſed the Apoſtles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed not man but God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. becauſe their calling was Gods ordinance, as alſo the Kings is. And this was the ground of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Argument, whereby he diſſwaded the Councell from uſing violence to the Apoſtles; becauſe if their power were from God, in fighting againſt the Apoſtles, they ſhould fight againſt God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. And therefore the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of this Commandement, being a ſinne properly againſt God, as the immediate object; this fift Commandement muſt needs be it Precept of the firſt Table.</p>
               <p>The fift Reaſon is taken from the nature of the puniſhment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> due to the ſinnes againſt this fift Commandement, and that is <hi>damnation, Rom.</hi> 13.2. which is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> third motive to obedience; for that puniſhment is generally due to all the ſins againſt the firſt Table, but not to all the ſins againſt the ſecond: For by damnation here in this Text, the Apoſtle muſt needs underſtand the puniſhment of temporall death, which the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Law ordained to be inflicted for every treſpaſſe againſt God, and the offences againſt the law of the firſt Table; which were judged (not according to the dammage which enſued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offence, like the offences againſt our neighbour, where a man was to looſe eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and the like; but) according to the quality of the perſon, againſt whom they were committed; for he that tranſgreſt the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by gathering onely a few ſticks, was commanded to be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114572:107"/>
ſtoned to death, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.15. And hee that blaſphemed or curſed God, was to die the death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.35. Now all tranſgreſſions againſt our parents were to be puniſhed after the ſame manner, and not according to the dammage which enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he that did ſmite his father or mother, was to be put to death, though no dammage enſued, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.15. Nay, if he did but curſe them, he was to ſuffer death, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments were not due by the Law, for any ſuch offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our neighbour, but onely againſt God, and ſinnes of the firſt Table; and therefore this fift Commandement muſt be a Precept of the firſt Table. And the reaſon why I doe judge this damnation to be meant of a temporall puniſhment, which is inflicted by the Magiſtrate, and not of eternall, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God; is, becauſe in reference to Gods eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all ſinnes are alike damnable and puniſhable with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation; and ſo Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon ſhould not be any motive more proper to perſwade this duty then any other; but in reference to temporall puniſhments inflicted by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, the ſinnes onely againſt God and the firſt Table, are made generally and univerſally capitall by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſame were alſo made capitall by the lawes of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for mens words againſt the King, may render them guilty of treaſon, and ſo of death, which mens words againſt their neighbours doe not doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The ſixt reaſon is grounded upon thoſe acts, which are ſaid to be the duties of the King, which are to <hi>revenge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, Ver.</hi> 3, 4. which is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> fourth motive to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Argument is this, To whomſoever the power of vengeance and recompence pertaineth, he is a God; for God himſelfe affirmeth thoſe prerogatives to be peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.35, 36. But both theſe prerogatives pertaine unto the King, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth in this Text; <hi>ergo,</hi> Kings are Gods, and by conſequence the fift Commandement which preſcribeth our duty to them, muſt be a Precept of the firſt Table.</p>

Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> fift motive to obedience. <hi>Wherefore ye must needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> Which reaſon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alledgeth alſo, to perſwade this kind of ſubmiſſion to Kings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelves for the Lords ſake,</hi> becauſe the ſubmiſſion is not to man but to God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.7. whoſe Majeſty and Authority the King doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent: and in the latter part of this ſecond Chapter, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preſſeth this kind of ſubmiſſion, for <hi>conſcience ſake, and the Lords ſake,</hi> by Chriſts example, who needed not to have ſubmitted to <hi>Pilate</hi> or the Jewes <hi>for wrath,</hi> (for he was able to overthrow them all with a blaſt of the breath of his mouth, as he did the officers, <hi>John</hi> 18.6. and ſhall doe Antichriſt at the laſt day, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.

               <p>The eight and laſt Reaſon is taken from the nature of thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> acts, whereby Subjects ought to expreſſe their obedience to Kings, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6, 7. which is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> fixt motive to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which acts doe referre either unto the Kings power, or elſe to his maintenance.</p>

For I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Argument preſuppoſeth that Generall to be truſted by the King, for the ſafety and protection of that city, and not for the deſtruction of it: and that upon this ſuppoſition, they doe reſiſt him as a Traitor to his truſt: and in this caſe the reſiſtance is lawfull; becauſe his Commiſſion doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that act, and he is onely a Magiſtrate, ſo farre as his Commiſſion doth authorize him. But ſuppoſe the King ſhould have judged that city to be deſtroyed, and authorize that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to execute that judgement; in this caſe it were abſolutely unlawfull to reſiſt, and all acts of oppoſition in the city or ſouldiery, (being the Kings Subjects) were abſolute treaſon and rebellion; becauſe the Kings Commiſſion from God doth extend abſolutely, both to our eſtates and perſons: nor doth he breake Gods truſt when he deſtroyes a city, becauſe as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. that judgement is Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the King is ſent by God to deſtroy thoſe cities, for the Tyrannicall Prince is Gods ſervant, for the execution of his judgements, and hath his heart guided by God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. as well as the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114572:109"/>
good Prince is for the diſpenſation of Gods mercies: And therefore to reſiſt a Tyrannicall King, is to reſiſt God, from whom that Tyrant doth derive his power, (as Chriſt teſtifieth of <hi>Pilates</hi> power, <hi>John</hi> 19.11.) which we may not doe, to ſave either our lives or eſtates.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To the third Argument: I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> that ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not ſufficient to legitimate one act expreſly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the Law of God; for even the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe doth record the failings of the moſt holy men, and that in the moſt notorious manner: as, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> lie to the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Davids</hi> Murder and Adultery, <hi>Solomons</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>Peters</hi> Perjury. Yea, and ſometimes we finde their ſins paſſed over without reproofe: (as in the Polygamie of <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> many of the Kings, and others,) yet the ſilence of the Holy Ghoſt in paſſing by this ſinne of Polygamie without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, did not make it lawfull. But for the inſtances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> they are all particularly anſwered by ſeverall Authors, who have writ of this ſubject. Only the reſiſtance and depoſition of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> is legitimated by Gods expreſſe approbation; but if you obſerve the Text, you ſhall finde that approbation relates to <hi>Rehoboams</hi> puniſhment, and loſſe of the tenne Tribes, and not to the peoples act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. For (ſaith the Lord) this thing is from me; that is, the renting the ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> according to his owne words to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.11. but for the peoples act of reſiſtance, it is termed a Rebellion, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.19. For though the depoſition of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and exaltation of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> was good and juſt in it ſelfe, (in regard it was the decree of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly declared to be his will, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.31.) yet in regard the people had no warrant to execute that decree, and in regard <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did not act in order to Gods decree; looking upon the execution of that decree againſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> (but upon the ſatisfaction of his ambitious deſires,) it was ſinfull, both in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the people. And that this was <hi>Jeroboams</hi> end, appeares plainly, becauſe he durſt not truſt God for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Honour and Dignity, (although God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the perpetuation thereof in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Ver.</hi> 38, as well as the donation,) but runne to the Devill for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114572:109"/>
of his Crowne; erecting two Calves for the people to worſhip, leſt, if the people ſhould goe up to Jeruſalem to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Lord ſhould not be able to continue their affections to him, nor performe his promiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.28. So that God did never approve the act of reſiſtance againſt the King, unleſſe by thoſe who had a particular warrant from himſelfe, as well for the manner, as the matter, as in <hi>Jehu's</hi> caſe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. without which, it is not lawfull for any man to endeavour his owne ſafety, by any reſiſtance or oppoſition of the Kings power, or any other acts of diſhonour to the King.</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This was the caſe of the Iſraelites with the Gibeonites, with whom the Iſraelites made a Covenant, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.15. contrary to a former expreſſe command from God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.32. <hi>Cha.</hi> 34.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.1. which Covenant therefore was (not oney pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the Iſraelites, but alſo) unlawfull in it ſelfe, yet after it was confirmed with an Oath by the Iſraelites, they might not breake it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.19. (although it was gained by fraud and ſubtilty, as appeares in the Text;) For when <hi>Saul</hi> did ignorantly, (out of zeale to the children of Iſrael and Judah,) (imagining the former command of God to lay an higher obligation upon them, then their own Oath ſo fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently procured,) breake that Covenant, and deſtroy the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3. the Lord revenged that perjuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act of <hi>Sauls,</hi> upon the whole land of Iſrael, by a conſtant famine, yeare after yeare, till the Honour of God was vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the ſatisfaction of the Gibeonites, in the bloud of ſeven

of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonnes, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves this caſe in expreſſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.5. Atteſting Gods regard of that mans happineſſe, who doth regard Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, (being thus engaged) above all ſelfe-reſpects, by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what he hath ſworne, though it be to his owne hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and therefore, the King may not breake a Law confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an Oath, although it be deſtructive to his owne Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The reaſon whereof is, Becauſe Gods Honour by that Oath is made an hoſtage for the Kings fidelity; and therefore, the King is bound to regard the performance of that Law, as he regards the Honour of Gods Name, which muſt have the preheminence above his owne Honour. Although all other Lawes (not ratified with this high ſanction) may, and ought to be revoked by the King, if they be prejudiciall to his owne Honour; for all ſuch Lawes are ſuppoſed to be fraudulently procured, like the grant of <hi>Mephiboſheth's</hi> eſtate to <hi>Ziba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1. (for no man would willingly diſhonour himſelf, for that were againſt the Law of Nature,) and therefore may be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as that Law of <hi>Davids</hi> was, by himſelfe, upon better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. But a Law confirmed by Oath, though fraudulently procured, may not be revoked upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information, (for that <hi>Joſhua</hi> received concerning the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.16.) yet all this muſt be underſtood of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters capable of this ſanction; that is, ſuch as are not deſtructive to the Honour of God, formerly engaged by himſelfe, even from all eternity; for Holineſſe is the very Nature and Eſſence of God, and all wicked Lawes which are oppoſite to this, are deſtructive to his eternall Honour, and therefore not capable of this ſanction of an Oath, for thereby Gods Honour is oppoſed to itſelfe: but where theſe two doe come in competition, the leſſe evill is to be made choice of; we muſt rather breake our Oath, (though that be deſtructive to Gods temporary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Honour) then act a wicked thing, (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his eſſentiall and eternall Honour.) But in all matters of indifference, which are capable of this ſanction of an Oath, that is the higheſt temporary ſanction, and therefore ought to be regarded above all former promiſes or reſolutions of our owne, although they be grounded upon a temporary

command from God, which is manifeſt in this caſe of the Gibeonites.</p>
               <p>Quaere. <hi>Seeing the Lawes preferring</hi> ſalus populi, <hi>before the Kings Honour, (being confirmed by the Kings Oath) doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King to act accordingly; whether doe not they likewiſe priviledge the people to act things prejudiciall to the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in order to their owne ſafety; eſpecially if the people have covenanted and ſworne the ſame Lawes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The acts of the King, and the acts of the people in this caſe, are of a farre different nature: For the acts of the King in obſervance to thoſe Lawes, are onely prejudiciall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne Honour, and ſo are onely <hi>mala poenae,</hi> and therefore capable of this ſacramentall ſanction from him. But as for the acts of the people in this caſe, they are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Honour, both of God and the King; which are ſinnes prohibited in the fift Commandement, (which enjoynes us to regard their Honour above all ſelfe-reſpects, (as I have formerly declared,) and therefore all acts of the people, either in the procurement or obſervance of ſuch Lawes, are <hi>mala culpae:</hi> For it is a ſacriledge of an high nature, to violate) and invade the ſacred Power and Prerogative of Kings, and therefore incapable of this ſacramentall ſanction from them. For all Aſſociations and Covenants, againſt any of Gods Commandements, are directly Covenants with Death, and agreements with Hell; and all the Oathes, Vowes, and Statutes, made and framed thereupon, are directly miſchiefes, framed by a Law, and Obligations ſealed to ſerve the Devill: And whether it be ſafer for us to continue in the ſervice of ſuch a Maſter, (by acting according to ſuch helliſh Oathes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,) or to forſake his ſervice, (by renouncing our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and giving Caeſar his ſacred right and due,) is not a caſe of any great difficulty to thoſe, who value God and ſalvation, above the Devill, and the damnation of their owne ſoules.</p>
